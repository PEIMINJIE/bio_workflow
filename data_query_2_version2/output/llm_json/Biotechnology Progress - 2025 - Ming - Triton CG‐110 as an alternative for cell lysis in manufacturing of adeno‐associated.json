        "Abstract (page 1 snippet provided by user): candidate detergents tested for cell lysis include Triton X-100, Tween 20, Tween 80, n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM), and Triton CG-110.",
        "Figure 4 caption and legend (PDF page 6 of 10 shown): harvest/clarification conditions include Triton X-100, Triton CG-110, and DDM; clarified cell lysate (CCL) generated using these detergents is further purified by affinity chromatography.",
        "Figure 5 caption and legend (PDF page 7 of 10 shown): at-scale clarification and affinity chromatography performed for CCL generated using Triton X-100 and Triton CG-110 (with COHC).",
        "Discussion text (PDF page 8 of 10 shown): explicitly states small-scale lysis tested Tween 20, Tween 80, DDM, and Triton CG-110; notes Tween 20 and Tween 80 were excluded due to high pressure during harvest/clarification.",
        "Conclusion (PDF page 9 of 10 shown): summarizes that Triton CG-110 used with clarification filters achieved comparable performance to Triton X-100 during harvest and subsequent affinity chromatography."
