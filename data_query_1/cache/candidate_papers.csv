"Rapid, Sensitive, and Low-Cost EsCas13d and RPA-Based Assay Platform for Rapid and Accurate Identification of SVA.",2026,10.1021/acsinfecdis.5c00889,41460219,ACS infectious diseases,"Rapid, sensitive, and user-friendly nucleic acid diagnostics are critical for controlling outbreaks of Seneca Valley virus (SVA). Here, we present Field-deployable Isothermal Enzymatic Lysis Detection (FIELD), an RNA detection platform for resource-limited settings that integrates rapid detection, operational simplicity, and minimal equipment requirements. FIELD employs a room-temperature lysis protocol to release viral nucleic acids within 2 min, followed by a single-step RPA-CRISPR/Cas13d reaction completed in 30 min. FIELD detects SVA RNA at 8 copies/μL using a plate reader and at 50 copies/μL via visual readout within 35 min, with no cross-reactivity against nontarget viruses. FIELD remains functional at both body (∼37 °C) and room (∼25 °C) temperatures, eliminating the need for temperature-controlled devices. Lyophilized FIELD reagents retain full activity for 1 week at room temperature and remain functional after long-distance transport and storage at 4 °C for up to two months, supporting field deployment. In a clinical evaluation of 88 field samples, FIELD achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity relative to RT-qPCR. Collectively, these features render FIELD well suited for point-of-care testing (POCT) beyond conventional laboratory settings.",PubMed,2026_acsinfecdis

Evaluation of direct-to-PCR (D2P) method for molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases.,2025,10.1016/j.yexmp.2025.104972,40424696,Experimental and molecular pathology,"This study evaluates the performance of the Direct-to-PCR (D2P) method as a streamlined, extraction-independent alternative to conventional nucleic acid extraction techniques for diagnosing urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, and respiratory tract infections. The D2P approach employs proprietary antimicrobial peptide-based lysis buffers tailored for bacterial, fungal, and viral targets, enabling direct amplification from clinical and contrived specimens without column- or bead-based purification. Comparative analyses were conducted against silica column-based (QIAGEN) and magnetic bead-based (KingFisher) extraction methods using both microbial reference isolates and 116 residual clinical samples. Results demonstrate that the D2P method yields comparable sensitivity and specificity to conventional extraction workflows across a diverse panel of pathogens-including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, Candida species, ssRNA viruses (e.g., CoV-229E, Parainfluenza Virus 1 and 2), and dsDNA viruses (e.g., HSV, HAdV). Notably, D2P outperformed both QIAGEN and KingFisher in extracting nucleic acids from Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen.

"A Hybrid Plasmonic Nanoplatform for One-Pot DNA and Antibody Detection of Hepatitis B, Monkeypox, and Associated Infections.",2025,10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c01407,40143629,Nano letters,"Currently, nucleic acid and antibody tests for infectious diseases are conducted independently, often resulting in fragmented diagnostics and delayed clinical decision-making. Given the diversity of analytes involved in infectious diseases, comprehensive detection is essential in clinical practice. Here, we introduce One-potNASH, a novel DNA and antibody hybrid plasmonic nanoplatform that unifies nucleic acid and antibody detection within a single assay. By integrating extraction-free thermal lysis of 1 μL of serum, One-potNASH achieves single-DNA copy sensitivity while enhancing antibody detection sensitivity by more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to that of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Clinically, One-potNASH for hepatitis B, monkeypox (MPX), and associated infections can detect DNA and multiplexed antibodies (anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV for hepatitis B and anti-A29L, anti-H3L, and anti-HIV for MPX) with 100% sensitivity and specificity. This integrated approach addresses critical clinical needs by streamlining workflows, reducing diagnosis time, and enabling a comprehensive evaluation of infectious diseases, thereby facilitating rapid therapeutic interventions and improved patient outcomes.",PubMed,2025_acsnanolett
Utility of Extraction-Free SARS-CoV-2 Detection by RT-qPCR for COVID-19 Testing in a Resource-Limited Setting.,2024,10.3390/diseases12090198,39329867,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)","The COVID-19 epidemic had a profound impact on global health and the economy and Ghana was no exception to its far-reaching consequences. Regarding detection of the causative agent-the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), reverse-transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) is widely recognized as a very sensitive and reliable diagnostic technique used globally. There are, however, high operational costs in acquiring test kits, equipment, and accessories for RT-qPCR testing, which pose significant challenges in resource-limited settings. Hence, this proof-of-concept study set out to develop a more affordable COVID-19 protocol for use in low or lower-middle-income settings, such as Ghana, that would bypass the traditional extraction process using inexpensive reagents and evaluate the possibility of processing samples collected using wooden shaft swabs. Several less expensive media were used for the extraction-free process. Results demonstrated that direct RT-qPCR assay after 5 min heat inactivation of virus at 95 °C in 0.1× PBS or molecular grade water resulted in viral detection with quantification cycle (Cq) values that are comparable to results obtained following the extraction process. Also, wooden shaft swabs could be used for sampling if incubation times are kept to less than 6 h. The study demonstrates that extraction-free protocols are one way to minimize the cost of COVID-19 testing by RT-qPCR.",PubMed,2024_diseases1209
"Assessment of DNA/RNA Defend Pro: An Inactivating Sample Collection Buffer for Enhanced Stability, Extraction-Free PCR, and Rapid Antigen Testing of Nasopharyngeal Swab Samples.",2024,10.3390/ijms25169097,39201783,International journal of molecular sciences,"This study comprehensively evaluated the DNA/RNA Defend Pro (DRDP) sample collection buffer, designed to inactivate and stabilize patient samples. The primary objectives were to assess DRDP's efficacy in ensuring sample stability, facilitating extraction-free polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ensuring compatibility with rapid antigen testing (RAT). Ninety-five diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab samples tested for influenza virus (influenza A), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A), and/or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were 10-fold diluted with DRDP and anonymized. Initial characterization and retesting of these samples using cobas Liat confirmed 88 samples as positive, validating the presence of viral targets. Results from rapid antigen testing showed lower sensitivity compared to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) but maintained perfect specificity, with 40 out of 88 positive samples by cobas Liat also testing positive for RAT. Direct RT-qPCR of DRDP-diluted samples demonstrated robust compatibility, with 72 out of 88 samples positive for cobas Liat also testing positive by direct RT-qPCR. Non-concordant results could be explained by the 200-fold lower input of extraction-free NAAT. Stability testing involved incubating 31 positive samples at 4 °C, 20 °C, and 37 °C for 7 days, with extraction-free NAAT. DRDP guaranteed viral RNA stability at all temperatures for influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV A, showing stability up to 7 days at 4 °C. In conclusion, DRDP is an effective stabilizing medium compatible with direct RT-qPCR and rapid antigen testing and shows great potential for optimizing diagnostic processes, particularly in resource-limited or time-sensitive scenarios.",PubMed,2024_ijms25169097
Dried Blood Matrix as a New Material for the Detection of DNA Viruses.,2024,10.1002/adhm.202402506,39075818,Advanced healthcare materials,"The gold standard for diagnosing viruses such as the Hepatitis B Virus has remained largely unchanged, relying on conventional methods involving extraction, purification, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This approach is hindered by limited availability, as it is time-consuming and requires highly trained personnel. Moreover, it suffers from low recovery rates of the nucleic acid molecules for samples with low copy numbers. To address the challenges of complex instrumentation and low recovery rate of DNA, a drying process coupled with thermal treatment of whole blood is employed, resulting in the creation of a dried blood matrix characterized by a porous structure with a high surface-to-volume ratio where it also inactivates the amplification inhibitors present in whole blood. Drawing on insights from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)- Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), detection assay is devised for HBV, as a demonstration, from whole blood with high recovery of DNA and simplified instrumentation achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 IU mL",PubMed,2024_adhm2024025

Development of Aptamers for RNase Inactivation in Xtract-Free™ Sample Collection and Transport Medium.,2024,10.3390/diagnostics14121207,38928623,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)","There is a significant need to develop new environmentally friendly, extraction-free sample collection mediums that can effectively preserve and protect genetic material for point-of-care and/or self-collection, home-collection, and mail-back testing. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) was used to create anti-ribonuclease (RNase) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) aptamers against purified RNase A conjugated to paramagnetic carboxylated beads. Following eight rounds of SELEX carried out under various stringency conditions, e.g., selection using Xtract-Free™ (XF) specimen collection medium and elevated ambient temperature of 28 °C, a panel of five aptamers was chosen following bioinformatic analysis using next-generation sequencing. The efficacy of aptamer inactivation of RNase was assessed by monitoring ribonucleic acid (RNA) integrity via fluorometric and real-time RT-PCR analysis. Inclusion of aptamers in reaction incubations resulted in an 8800- to 11,200-fold reduction in RNase activity, i.e., digestion of viral RNA compared to control. Thus, anti-RNase aptamers integrated into XF collection medium as well as other commercial reagents and kits have great potential for ensuring quality intact RNA for subsequent genomic analyses.",PubMed,2024_diagnostics1
Large-volume RT-LAMP enables extraction-free amplification of HIV RNA from fingerstick plasma.,2024,10.1016/j.aca.2024.342560,38719398,Analytica chimica acta,"Point-of-care (POC) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can significantly expand testing coverage, which is critical for infectious disease diagnostics and monitoring. The development of various isothermal amplification techniques greatly simplifies NAATs, but the cumbersome nucleic acid extraction step remains a bottleneck for the POC. Alternatively, extraction-free amplification, where crude samples are directly added into the assay, substantially simplifies the workflow. However, sample dilution is often needed in extraction-free amplification to reduce assay inhibition from sample matrices. Since NAATs are typically run at small volumes around 20 μL, the input sample quantity is therefore limited, resulting in an inevitable sensitivity loss.",PubMed,2024_jaca20243
A portable all-in-one microfluidic device with real-time colorimetric LAMP for HPV16 and HPV18 DNA point-of-care testing.,2024,10.1016/j.bios.2023.115968,38150799,Biosensors & bioelectronics,"Screening for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most important preventative measures for cervical cancer. However, fast, convenient, and low-cost HPV detection remains challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Here, we report a portable all-in-one device (PAD) for point-of-care testing (POCT) for HPV16 and HPV18 DNA in cervical swabs. The PAD was engineered to integrate modules for extraction-free sample lysis, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with lyophilized reagent beads, and real-time colorimetric signal sensing into a single miniaturized device, considerably shortening the sample-to-result time to 15 min. The precision liquid handling in the completely sealed microfluidic chip is achieved by a uniquely designed pressure-balanced automatic liquid flow mechanism, thereby eliminating the need for manual manipulation of liquids and thus the risk of biohazards. The PAD employs an improved real-time colorimetric LAMP (rcLAMP) assay with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 copy/μL, enabled by enhanced assay chemistry to maximize the reaction kinetics. To validate this device for clinical application, we tested 206 clinical cervical swab samples and obtained a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 99.0%.

Pre-analytical properties of different respiratory viruses for PCR-based detection: Comparative analysis of sampling devices and sample stabilization solutions.,2024,10.1016/j.nbt.2023.12.005,38145650,New biotechnology,"After the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems were challenged by the simultaneous prevalence of different respiratory viruses causing a wide overlap in symptoms. This increased the demand for multi-virus diagnostic tests which require suitable pre-analytical workflow solutions in order to receive valid diagnostic results. In this context, the effects of specimen storage duration and temperature on the RNA/DNA copy number stability of influenza A/B, RSV A/B, SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus were examined for four commercially available transport swab systems and saliva collection devices. The respiratory viruses were more stable in the saliva collection devices than in the transport swab systems when stored at RT or 37 °C for up to 96 h. Moreover, no differences between viral nucleic acid stability of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were observed. The infectivity of all enveloped viruses could be inactivated by the saliva collection device from PreAnalytiX. The Norgen saliva device completely inactivated influenza A/B, while RSV A/B were partially inactivated. The non-enveloped adenovirus was inactivated by a reduction factor of 10E+ 4 in both saliva collection devices. All respiratory viruses remained infectious in the transport swab systems. Two possible transport medium additives were tested which inactivated or strongly reduced viral replication of tested enveloped viruses but had no effect on the non-enveloped adenovirus. Finally the implementation of multi-target detection procedures involving a direct amplification approach was successfully tested by spike-in of all enveloped viruses simultaneously into transport swab systems. This fast and reproducible setup presents a valuable solution for future implementations in multi-virus testing strategies.",PubMed,2024_jnbt20231

Method versatility in RNA extraction-free PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples.,2023,10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2023.06.004,37369293,Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,"Early in the pandemic, a simple, open-source, RNA extraction-free RT-qPCR protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva was developed and made widely available. This simplified approach (SalivaDirect) requires only sample treatment with proteinase K prior to PCR testing. However, feedback from clinical laboratories highlighted a need for a flexible workflow that can be seamlessly integrated into their current health and safety requirements for the receiving and handling of potentially infectious samples. To address these varying needs, we explored additional pre-PCR workflows. We built upon the original SalivaDirect workflow to include an initial incubation step (95 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 5 min or 65 °C for 15 min) with or without addition of proteinase K. The limit of detection for the workflows tested did not significantly differ from that of the original SalivaDirect workflow. When tested on de-identified saliva samples from confirmed COVID-19 individuals, these workflows also produced comparable virus detection and assay sensitivities, as determined by RT-qPCR analysis. Exclusion of proteinase K did not negatively affect the sensitivity of the assay. The addition of multiple heat pretreatment options to the SalivaDirect protocol increases the accessibility of this cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 test as it gives diagnostic laboratories the flexibility to implement the workflow which best suits their safety protocols.",PubMed,2023_jpbiomolbio
Pooled RNA-extraction-free testing of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.,2023,10.1038/s41598-023-34662-2,37156888,Scientific reports,"The key to limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread is to identify virus-infected individuals (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) and isolate them from the general population. Hence, routine weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2 in all asymptomatic (capturing both infected and non-infected) individuals is considered critical in situations where a large number of individuals co-congregate such as schools, prisons, aged care facilities and industrial workplaces. Such testing is hampered by operational issues such as cost, test availability, access to healthcare workers and throughput. We developed the SalivaDirect RT-qPCR assay to increase access to SARS-CoV-2 testing via a low-cost, streamlined protocol using self-collected saliva. To expand the single sample testing protocol, we explored multiple extraction-free pooled saliva testing workflows prior to testing with the SalivaDirect RT-qPCR assay. A pool size of five, with or without heat inactivation at 65 °C for 15 min prior to testing resulted in a positive agreement of 98% and 89%, respectively, and an increased Ct value shift of 1.37 and 1.99 as compared to individual testing of the positive clinical saliva specimens. Applying this shift in Ct value to 316 individual, sequentially collected, SARS-CoV-2 positive saliva specimen results reported from six clinical laboratories using the original SalivaDirect assay, 100% of the samples would have been detected (Ct value < 45) had they been tested in the 1:5 pool strategy.

A rapid, sensitive, and on-site SARS-CoV-2 genotyping technique is urgently needed for individual diagnosis and routine surveillance. Here, a field-deployable ultrasensitive CRISPR-based diagnostics system, called Chemical additive-Enhanced Single-Step Accurate CRISPR/Cas13 Testing system (CESSAT), for simultaneous screening of SARS-CoV-2 and its five VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) within 40 min was reported. In this system, a single-step reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification-CRISPR/Cas13a assay was incorporated with optimized extraction-free viral lysis and reagent lyophilization, which could eliminate complicated sample processing steps and rigorous reagent storage conditions. Remarkably, 10% glycine as a chemical additive could improve the assay sensitivity by 10 times, making the limit of detection as low as 1 copy/μL (5 copies/reaction). A compact optic fiber-integrated smartphone-based device was developed for sample lysis, assay incubation, fluorescence imaging, and result interpretation. CESSAT could specifically differentiate the synthetic pseudovirus of SARS-CoV-2 and its five VOCs. The genotyping results for 40 clinical samples were in 100% concordance with standard method.

The virus inactivation ability of RTU-Direct reagent was confirmed by viral infectivity assays involving RTU-Direct-treated samples containing RSV and human coronavirus OC43. RSV RNA stability was significantly better in RTU-Direct reagent than in conventional virus transport medium (VTM) at room temperature and 4°C (p < 0.05). The clinical performance of the RTU-Direct test was evaluated using 155 respiratory specimens from patients with suspected RSV infection.

The CCTC lab operation focussed on the optimised use of automation, introduction of novel technologies and process modelling to enable a testing capacity of 22,000 tests per day. Here we describe the optimisation of the laboratory process through the continued exploitation of internal performance metrics, while introducing new technologies including the Heat Inactivation of clinical samples upon receipt into the laboratory and a Direct to PCR protocol that removed the requirement for the RNA extraction step. We anticipate that these methods will have value in driving continued efficiency and effectiveness within all large scale viral diagnostic testing laboratories.",PubMed,2022_s41598-022-0
Heat inactivation of clinical COVID-19 samples on an industrial scale for low risk and efficient high-throughput qRT-PCR diagnostic testing.,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-06888-z,35190592,Scientific reports,"We report the development of a large scale process for heat inactivation of clinical COVID-19 samples prior to laboratory processing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. With more than 266 million confirmed cases, over 5.26 million deaths already recorded at the time of writing, COVID-19 continues to spread in many parts of the world. Consequently, mass testing for SARS-CoV-2 will remain at the forefront of the COVID-19 response and prevention for the near future. Due to biosafety considerations the standard testing process requires a significant amount of manual handling of patient samples within calibrated microbiological safety cabinets. This makes the process expensive, effects operator ergonomics and restricts testing to higher containment level laboratories. We have successfully modified the process by using industrial catering ovens for bulk heat inactivation of oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab samples within their secondary containment packaging before processing in the lab to enable all subsequent activities to be performed in the open laboratory. As part of a validation process, we tested greater than 1200 clinical COVID-19 samples and showed less than 1 Cq loss in RT-qPCR test sensitivity. We also demonstrate the bulk heat inactivation protocol inactivates a murine surrogate of human SARS-CoV-2. Using bulk heat inactivation, the assay is no longer reliant on containment level 2 facilities and practices, which reduces cost, improves operator safety and ergonomics and makes the process scalable. In addition, heating as the sole method of virus inactivation is ideally suited to streamlined and more rapid workflows such as 'direct to PCR' assays that do not involve RNA extraction or chemical neutralisation methods.",PubMed,2022_s41598-022-0
Molecular Characterization of Increased Amplicon Lengths in SARS-CoV-2 Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays.,2021,10.7171/jbt.21-3203-015,35027877,Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a power tool for the amplification of specific RNA and DNA targets. Much like PCR, LAMP requires primers that surround a target amplification region and generates exponential product through a unique highly specific daisy-chain single-temperature amplification reaction. However, until recently, attempts to amplify targets of greater than 200 base pairs (bp) have been mostly unsuccessful and limited to short amplicon targets of less than 150 bp. Although short amplicons have the benefit of a rapid detection (<40 min), they do not allow for the prediction of RNA integrity based on RNA length and possible intactness. In this study, 8 primer sets were developed using 2 LAMP primer-specific software packages against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid gene with insert lengths ranging from 262 to 945 bp in order to amplify and infer the integrity of viral RNA. Because these amplification lengths are greater than the current methods that use an insert length of 130 or less, they require a longer incubation, modified primer and temperature strategies, and the addition of specific adjuncts to prevent nonspecific amplification. This proof of concept study resulted in successful reverse transcription LAMP reactions for amplicon targets of 262, 687, 693, and 945 bp using a clinical nasopharyngeal NP sample, purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and crude lysate containing inactivated virus.",PubMed,2021_jbt21-3203-

Rapid and accurate viral detection is a starting point in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic and flavivirus outbreaks. However, the shortage of diagnostic reagents and supplies, especially in resource-limited countries that experience co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and flaviviruses, are limitations that may result in lesser availability of RT-qPCR-based diagnostic tests. In this study, the utility of RNA-free extraction methods was assessed for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2 in heat-inactivated or chemical-inactivated samples. The findings demonstrate that direct real-time RT-qPCR is a feasible option in comparison to conventional real-time RT-qPCR based on viral genome extraction-based methods.

Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital droplet PCR were compared to the current conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient specimens. The heat treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction shortens the overall diagnostic workflow.

Such a strategy should rely on disparate diagnostic tests to prevent a slowdown in testing due to lack of materials and reagents imposed by supply chain problems, which happened at the beginning of the pandemic. In this study, we have established a single-tube test based on RT-LAMP that enables the visual detection of less than 100 viral genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 within 30 min. We benchmarked the assay against the gold standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis, RT-PCR, using 177 nasopharyngeal RNA samples. For viral loads above 100 copies, the RT-LAMP assay had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96.1%. Additionally, we set up a RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP test capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 directly from saliva samples, albeit with lower sensitivity. The saliva was self-collected and the collection tube remained closed until inactivation, thereby ensuring the protection of the testing personnel. As expected, RNA extraction from saliva samples increased the sensitivity of the test. To lower the costs associated with RNA extraction, we performed this step using an alternative protocol that uses plasmid DNA extraction columns. We also produced the enzymes needed for the assay and established an in-house-made RT-LAMP test independent of specific distribution channels. Finally, we developed a new colorimetric method that allowed the detection of LAMP products by the visualization of an evident color shift, regardless of the reaction pH.",PubMed,2021_s41598-021-9

The sensitivity of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample transport and storage media as well as the viral loads (as measured by qRT-PCR Ct levels).

However, rapid, point-of-care tests often have lower sensitivity in practice. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 has proven sensitive and specific and provides visual results in minutes. Using a commercially available kit for RT-LAMP and primer set targetting nucleocapsid (N), we tested a blinded set of 101 archived nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples with known RT-PCR results. RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min, using heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab sample in viral transport medium, diluted tenfold in water, as input.

Survival of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in retail pasteurised milk.,2018,10.1016/j.fm.2018.03.004,29706338,Food microbiology,"A survey of retail purchased semi-skimmed pasteurised milk (n = 368) for Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) was conducted between May 2014 and June 2015 across the midlands of England using the Phage-PCR assay. Overall, 10.3% of the total samples collected contained viable MAP cells, confirming that pasteurisation is not capable of fully eliminating human exposure to viable MAP through milk. Comparison of the results gained using the Phage-PCR assay with the results of surveys using either culture or direct PCR suggest that the phage-PCR assay is able to detect lower numbers of cells, resulting in an increase in the number of MAP-positive samples detected. Comparison of viable count and levels of MAP detected in bulk milk samples suggest that MAP is not primarily introduced into the milk by faecal contamination but rather are shed directly into the milk within the udder. In addition results detected an asymmetric distribution of MAP exists in the milk matrix prior to somatic cell lysis, indicating that the bacterial cells in naturally contaminated milk are clustered together and may primarily be located within somatic cells. These latter two results lead to the hypothesis that intracellular MAP within the somatic cells may be protected against heat inactivation during pasteurisation, accounting for the presence of low levels of MAP detected in retail milk.",PubMed,2018_jfm201803
Simplifying Nucleic Acid Amplification from Whole Blood with Direct Polymerase Chain Reaction on Chitosan Microparticles.,2017,10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00274,28245111,Analytical chemistry,"Tremendous advances have been made in the development of portable nucleic acid amplification devices for near-patient use. However, the true limitation in the realization of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for near-patient applications is not the amplification reaction, it is the complexity of the sample preparation. Conventional approaches require several precise intervention steps during the protocol. There are numerous reports in the literature that mimic the sample preparation procedure within a lab-on-a-chip device or cartridge, but these systems require a high number of integrated steps, making the devices and/or their supporting equipment too complex to meet the necessary cost targets and regulatory requirements for near-patient applications. Here we report a simplified method to purify and amplify DNA from complex samples in a minimal number of steps. We show that chitosan-coated microparticles can lyse human cells and capture the released DNA in a single mechanical agitation step, and we show that bound DNA can be amplified directly from the microparticle surface when the magnetic microparticles are transferred to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This procedure eliminates (i) the use of PCR-inhibiting reagents (e.g., chaotropic salts and alcohol) and (ii) the washing and elution steps that are required to remove these reagents and release DNA in typical NAAT sample preparation methods. To illustrate the use of this direct PCR method in diagnostics, we amplify human genomic DNA sequences from a ∼1 μL droplet of whole blood, and we amplify plasmid DNA spiked into whole blood droplets to represent circulating viral DNA or cell-free DNA. The qPCR threshold cycle for direct PCR from whole blood is comparable to that of direct PCR with purified DNA, demonstrating that the lysis and capture steps effectively bind DNA and sufficiently enable its amplification. Furthermore, the efficient amplification of plasmid DNA spiked into whole blood proves that the large mass of human genomic DNA captured from the lysed cells does not inhibit the capture and amplification of other circulating DNA. We anticipate that this new streamlined method for preparing DNA for amplification will expand the diagnostic applications of nucleic acid amplification tests, in particular for near-patient applications.",PubMed,2017_acsanalchem
