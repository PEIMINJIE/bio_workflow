Integrating the affinity and anion-exchange purification of AAV8: how the selective enrichment of full capsids at the affinity capture step enhances the downstream processing of gene therapies.,2026,10.1016/j.chroma.2025.466557,41297510,Journal of chromatography. A,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are revolutionizing gene therapy with remarkable therapeutic potential. Yet, their clinical translation is limited by inadequate biomanufacturing technologies that compromise product quality and accessibility. Addressing these issues, this study systematically investigates the conditions used for midstream and downstream AAV processing - namely, HEK293 cell lysis, tangential flow filtration (TFF), and chromatographic purification - and their impact on product yield and quality using AAV8 as a model serotype. We evaluated a panel of detergents (Triton X-100, sodium deoxycholate, Deviron C16/S9-13, CTAB, AAV-MAX) and salts (KCl, NaCl), and found that, while the capsid yields were similar across the various lysates, the subsequent process steps exhibited a strong dependence on lysis conditions. In particular, residual detergents in the lysates affected the efficiency of the TFF step by reducing permeate flux and necessitating the use of membranes with higher molecular weight cut-offs or additional buffer exchange prior to affinity capture. Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate afforded efficient cell lysis and high vector yields, but compromised TFF throughput. Conversely, lysates produced using salts or CTAB enabled robust TFF, with high permeate flux, and maintained capsid recoveries above 75 %. The subsequent affinity capture of AAV8 from selected lysates using AvXcel resin afforded yields of 45 - 70 %, >100-fold reduction in host cell impurities, and a 1.9-fold enrichment of cell-transducing units. Product polishing by anion-exchange chromatography reached final titers of 5.0 - 7.7 × 10",PubMed

An SDS-NaOH-based method to isolate genome of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors for physical titer measurement.,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0315921,40179116,PloS one,"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) vectors are promising for their safety and sustained expression of genetic payloads across various tissues. These vectors consist of a protein capsid enclosing a 4.7 kb single-stranded DNA genome. Rapid and accurate determination of the physical titers of rAAV vector is crucial for quality control in rAAV manufacturing and precise drug dosage in clinical trials. To prepare vector DNA for genome titer assessment, it is essential to completely degrade unencapsulated DNA and dissociate the capsid. Conventional methods typically involve co-incubation with DNase I to degrade unencapsidated DNA, followed by co-incubation with Proteinase K to cleave protein shells. Here, we present a ""Benzonase & SDS-NaOH"" pretreatment as an effective alkaline lysis for releasing the vector DNA. In the presence of producer cell crude extract, Benzonase demonstrated superior efficacy in degrading unencapsidated DNA compared to DNase I. Additionally, the use of SDS-NaOH, effective at 65 °C for 30 min, significantly reduces the time required compared to that of Proteinase K at 56 °C for 2 hours. We also showed that the ""Benzonase & SDS-NaOH"" pretreatment is applicable for vector genome titration in rAAV production, harvest, and purified stock. Moreover, our method is effective for both scAAV and ssAAV forms and across all serotypes, including the thermally stable rAAV5. Overall, this method offers a rapid and straightforward solution to determine rAAV vector genome titers in both purified preparations and during the manufacturing process.",PubMed
Triton CG-110 as an alternative for cell lysis in manufacturing of adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy.,2025,10.1002/btpr.70025,40135817,Biotechnology progress,"Triton X-100 is one of the most widely used detergents for cell lysis in gene therapy product manufacturing. However, due to the aquatic toxicity of the degradation product, Triton X-100 is regulated by the European Chemical Agency as a substance of very high concern. In this study, we aim to identify eco-friendly detergent alternatives to replace Triton X-100. Tween 20, Tween 80, n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM), and Triton CG-110 were tested and compared with Triton X-100. Triton CG-110 demonstrated similar performance during the harvest and subsequent purification process for multiple AAV vectors at different scales. Therefore, Triton CG-110 represents an effective and environmentally safe detergent alternative to Triton X-100.",PubMed
Streamlining viral safety in AAV manufacturing: Simultaneous cell lysis and viral inactivation using biodegradable detergents.,2025,10.1016/j.xphs.2025.103761,40107420,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,"Ensuring viral safety in biopharmaceutical production is vital for global regulatory standards adherence and safeguarding patients. This study evaluates the efficacy of newly developed biodegradable detergent formulations, designed to comply with regulatory requirements, for inactivating enveloped viruses during the cell lysis step of adeno-associated virus (AAV) production. Virus clearance (VC) studies showed robust inactivation kinetics against Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (XMuLV), achieving a log reduction value (LRV) of ≥5.34 within 30 to 120 min. Comparative testing in crude cell lysate and PBS buffer showed consistent viral inactivation across different matrices, highlighting the versatility of the detergent formulations. Importantly, the detergent composition preserved AAV capsid integrity, and subsequent purification steps, including affinity and ion-exchange chromatography, effectively removed residual detergent. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of biodegradable detergents to simultaneously facilitate cell lysis and viral inactivation in AAV manufacturing, offering a sustainable alternative that aligns with industry standards.",PubMed
High-transition-temperature paraffin integration in IFAST device for efficient and robust nucleic acid extraction and detection.,2025,10.1016/j.bios.2025.117314,40054157,Biosensors & bioelectronics,"Infectious diseases are prevalent in resource-limited regions with restricted access to health care. Nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for pathogen diagnosis. However, traditional methods are resource-intensive, which limits their use in point-of-care settings. Microfluidic technologies, such as the immiscible phase filtration-assisted system (IFAST) using paramagnetic particles (PMPs), simplify nucleic acid extraction but face barrier stability issues. The interface between the aqueous and oil phases in current IFAST systems is destabilized under the conditions required for efficient RNA extraction. These conditions include the use of reagents containing high concentrations of surfactants and organic solvents, as well as thermal treatment, which reduces the operational stability, reproducibility, and compatibility of the current IFAST systems. We developed a high-transition-temperature (HTT) paraffin-embedded IFAST-based device to improve barrier stability and extraction efficiency. HTT paraffin remains semi-solid at 65 °C, providing a robust barrier during the thermal lysis and RT-LAMP processes. At 75 °C, the device maintained compartment integrity and reduced carryover during the nucleic acid-bound magnetic particle transfer. Testing with SARS-CoV-2 samples showed detection of as little as 1 copy/μL of the viral genome without false positives. By integrating RNA extraction and colorimetric RT-LAMP detection, this device provided rapid on-site testing, advancing accessible and effective disease management in regions that require rapid diagnostics.",PubMed
Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 capsids with proteolytic cuts by trypsin remain intact and potent.,2025,10.1038/s41434-024-00507-4,39613903,Gene therapy,"Recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have emerged as prominent gene delivery vehicles for gene therapy. In the journey of an AAV vector, AAV vectors can be exposed to different proteolytic environments inside the production cells, during the cell lysis step, within the endosome, and finally inside the cell nucleus. The stability of a modified AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) capsid was evaluated via a proteolytic approach using trypsin and other proteases and both denaturing and non-denaturing analytical methods. Trypsin digestion of the AAV2 capsids resulted in clips of the capsid proteins at the C-terminus as confirmed by denaturing methods including SDS-PAGE, CE-SDS, Western blot, and RPLC-MS. It was found that the AAV2 capsid with clips not only remains structurally intact, as confirmed by non-denaturing methods including SEC, thermostability testing, and cryo-EM, but also remains potent, as confirmed in a cell-based potency assay. This finding reveals that AAV2 capsid with proteolytic cuts remains intact and potent since the icosahedral three-dimensional structural arrangement of AAV capsid proteins can protect the clipped fragment from being released from the capsid, such that the AAV capsid remains intact allowing for the functionality to be maintained to deliver the DNA in the host cell. Evaluation of AAV stability using a proteolytic approach and multiple denaturing and non-denaturing analytical methods can provide valuable information for engineering AAV capsids to develop AAV-based gene therapy.",PubMed
Nucleotide Resolution Mapping of Rift Valley Fever Virus Nucleoprotein-Genome RNA Interactions.,2024,10.1007/978-1-0716-3926-9_18,39039419,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; genus Phlebovirus, family Phenuiviridae, order Bunyavirales) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen endemic in Africa. Its negative-stranded genomic RNA (vRNA) is divided into three segments termed L, M, and S. Both vRNAs and antigenomic cRNAs are encapsidated by viral nucleoprotein (N) to form nucleocapsids, which constitute the template for genome transcription and replication. Based on a number of electron microscopy and structural studies, the viral RNAs of negative-strand RNA viruses, including phleboviruses, are commonly considered to be entirely and uniformly covered by N protein. However, high resolution data supporting this notion was missing to date.Here, we describe a method how to globally map all N-RNA interactions of RVFV by using iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation). The protocol is based on covalent cross-linking of direct protein-RNA interactions by UV irradiation. Following sample lysis, a selective isolation of N in complex with its RNA targets is achieved by immunoprecipitation. Then, N-RNA complexes are separated by SDS-PAGE, and after membrane transfer, RNA is isolated and subjected to library preparation and high-throughput sequencing. We explain how the standard iCLIP protocol can be adapted to RVFV N-RNA interaction studies. The protocol describes mapping of all N interactions with the vRNAs and cRNAs derived either from RVFV particles or from infected cells.",PubMed

Efficacy Validation of SARS-CoV-2-Inactivation and Viral Genome Stability in Saliva by a Guanidine Hydrochloride and Surfactant-Based Virus Lysis/Transport Buffer.,2023,10.3390/v15020509,36851723,Viruses,"To enhance biosafety and reliability in SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, virus lysis/transport buffers should inactivate the virus and preserve viral RNA under various conditions. Herein, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activity of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)- and surfactant (hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (Hexa-DTMC))-based buffer, Prep Buffer A, (Precision System Science Co., Ltd., Matsudo, Japan) and its efficacy in maintaining the stability of viral RNA at different temperatures using the traditional real-time one-step RT-PCR and geneLEAD VIII sample-to-result platform. Although Prep Buffer A successfully inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in solutions with high and low organic substance loading, there was considerable viral genome degradation at 35 °C compared with that at 4 °C. The individual roles of GuHCl and Hexa-DTMC in virus inactivation and virus genome stability at 35 °C were clarified. Hexa-DTMC alone (0.384%), but not 1.5 M GuHCl alone, exhibited considerable virucidal activity, suggesting that it was essential for potently inactivating SARS-CoV-2 using Prep Buffer A. GuHCl and Hexa-DTMC individually reduced the viral copy numbers to the same degree as Prep Buffer A. Although both components inhibited RNase activity, Hexa-DTMC, but not GuHCl, directly destroyed naked viral RNA. Our findings suggest that samples collected in Prep Buffer A should be stored at 4 °C when RT-PCR will not be performed for several days.",PubMed
Isolation and characterization of a Vibrio owensii phage phi50-12.,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-20831-2,36180722,Scientific reports,"Vibrio owensii is a widely distributed marine vibrio species that causes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis in the larvae of Panulirus ornatus and Penaeus vannamei, and is also associated with Montipora white syndrome in corals. We characterized V. owensii GRA50-12 as a potent pathogen using phenotypic, biochemical, and zebrafish models. A virulent phage, vB_VowP_phi50-12 (phi50-12), belonging to the N4-like Podoviridae, was isolated from the same habitat as that of V. owensii GRA50-12 and characterized. This phage possesses a unique sequence with no similar hits in the public databases and has a short latent time (30 min), a large burst size (106 PFU/infected cell), and a wide range of pH and temperature stabilities. Moreover, phi50-12 also demonstrated a strong lysis ability against V. owensii GRA50-12. SDS-PAGE revealed at least nine structural proteins, four of which were confirmed using LC-MS/MS analysis. The size of the phi50-12 genome was 68,059 bp, with 38.5% G + C content. A total of 101 ORFs were annotated, with 17 ORFs having closely related counterparts in the N4-like vibrio phage. Genomic sequencing confirmed the absence of antibiotic resistance genes or virulence factors. Comparative studies have shown that phi50-12 has a unique genomic arrangement, except for the well-conserved core regions of the N4-like phages. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that it belonged to a group of smaller genomes of N4-like vibrio phages. The therapeutic effect in the zebrafish model suggests that phi50-12 could be a potential candidate for application in the treatment of V. owensii infection or as a biocontrol agent. However, further research must be carried out to confirm the efficacy of phage50-12.",PubMed

Oxidative stress transforms 3CLpro into an insoluble and more active form to promote SARS-CoV-2 replication.,2021,10.1016/j.redox.2021.102199,34847508,Redox biology,"3CLpro is a key proteinase for SARS-CoV-2 replication and serves as an important target for antiviral drug development. However, how its activity is regulated intracellularly is still obscure. In this study, we developed a 3CLpro protease activity reporter system to examine the impact of various factors, including nutrient supplements, ions, pHs, or oxidative stress inducers, on 3CLpro protease activity. We found that oxidative stress could increase the overall activity of 3CLpro. Not altering the expression, oxidative stress decreased the solubility of 3CLpro in the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X-100. The Triton-X-100-insoluble 3CLpro was correlated with aggregates' formation and responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. The disulfide bonds formed between Cys85 sites of 3CLpro protomers account for the insolubility and the aggregation of 3CLpro. Besides being regulated by oxidative stress, 3CLpro impaired the cellular antioxidant capacity by regulating the cleavage of GPx1 at its N-terminus. This cleavage could further elevate the 3CLpro-proximate oxidative activity, favor aggregation and activation of 3CLpro, and thus lead to a positive feedback loop. In summary, we reported that oxidative stress transforms 3CLpro into a detergent-insoluble form that is more enzymatically active, leading to increased viral replication/transcription. Our study provided mechanistic evidence that suggests the therapeutic potential of antioxidants in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients.",PubMed
Evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 Inactivation Efficacy Associated With Buffers From Three Kits Used on High-Throughput RNA Extraction Platforms.,2021,10.3389/fcimb.2021.716436,34604108,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"Rapid and demonstrable inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to ensure operator safety during high-throughput testing of clinical samples.

Inactivation of Coronaviruses during Sample Preparation for Proteomics Experiments.,2021,10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00320,34432478,Journal of proteome research,"Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is applied in SARS-CoV-2 research and is, moreover, being discussed as a novel method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. However, the safe inactivation of coronaviruses by proteomics lysis buffers has not been systematically analyzed yet. Hence, for safety reasons a heating step prior to sample preparation is often performed. This step could be omitted once the safe inactivation with the typical buffers is proven. Here we test five different proteomics lysis buffers-4% SDS, 1% SDC, TFA, 6 M GdmCl, and 8 M urea-for their inactivation capacity of coronaviruses. Two representative human coronaviruses, namely HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were used as surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. Lysis was performed at room temperature and at 95 °C for 5 min. Inactivation was confirmed by the absence of a cytopathic effect in MRC-5 cells, and equivocal results were further confirmed by serial passaging and quantitative real-time PCR. While at room temperature SDS, SDC, and TFA inactivated both coronaviruses, and GdmCl and urea resulted in partially incomplete inactivation. This demonstrates that care should be taken when choosing lysis buffers for proteomics analysis of coronaviruses, because some buffers do not ensure inactivation and, hence, biosafety during the further sample preparation.",PubMed
Direct RT-PCR amplification of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples using a concentrated viral lysis-amplification buffer prepared with IGEPAL-630.,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-93333-2,34244543,Scientific reports,"The pandemic of 2019 caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still rapidly spreading worldwide. Nucleic acid amplification serves as the gold standard method for confirmation of COVID-19 infection. However, challenges faced for diagnostic laboratories from undeveloped countries includes shortage of kits and supplies to purify viral RNA. Therefore, it is urgent to validate alternative nucleic acid isolation methods for SARS-CoV-2. Our results demonstrate that a concentrated viral lysis amplification buffer (vLAB) prepared with the nonionic detergent IGEPAL enables qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 by direct Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (dRT-PCR). Furthermore, vLAB was effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Since this method is inexpensive and no RNA purification equipment or additional cDNA synthesis is required, this dRT-PCR with vLAB should be considered as an alternative method for qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2.",PubMed
Versatile and flexible microfluidic qPCR test for high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 and cellular response detection in nasopharyngeal swab samples.,2021,10.1371/journal.pone.0243333,33852580,PloS one,"The emergence and quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pointed at a low capacity response for testing large populations in many countries, in line of material, technical and staff limitations. The traditional RT-qPCR diagnostic test remains the reference method and is by far the most widely used test. These assays are limited to a few probe sets, require large sample PCR reaction volumes, along with an expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction step. Here we describe a quantitative nanofluidic assay that overcomes some of these shortcomings, based on the BiomarkTM instrument from Fluidigm. This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of BiomarkTM reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities.",PubMed

Autoinduction occurs in a two-stage process wherein heterologous protein expression and autolysis enzymes are induced upon entry into stationary phase by phosphate depletion. Cytoplasmic lysozyme and periplasmic endonuclease are kept from inducing lysis until membrane integrity is disrupted. After cell harvest, the addition of detergent (0.1% Triton X-100) and a single 30 min freeze-thaw cycle results in >90% release of protein, green fluorescent protein. This cellular lysis is accompanied by complete oligonucleotide hydrolysis.

Endoplasmic Reticulum Detergent-Resistant Membranes Accommodate Hepatitis C Virus Proteins for Viral Assembly.,2019,10.3390/cells8050487,31121874,Cells,"During Hepatitis C virus (HCV) morphogenesis, the non-structural protein 2 (NS2) brings the envelope proteins 1 and 2 (E1, E2), NS3, and NS5A together to form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, initiating HCV assembly. The nature of the interactions in this complex is unclear, but replication complex and structural proteins have been shown to be associated with cellular membrane structures called detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). We investigated the role of DRMs in NS2 complex formation, using a lysis buffer combining Triton and n-octyl glucoside, which solubilized both cell membranes and DRMs. When this lysis buffer was used on HCV-infected cells and the resulting lysates were subjected to flotation gradient centrifugation, all viral proteins and DRM-resident proteins were found in soluble protein fractions. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated direct protein-protein interactions between NS2 and E2 and E1 proteins, and an association of NS2 with NS3 through DRMs. The well-folded E1E2 complex and NS5A were not associated, instead interacting separately with the NS2-E1-E2-NS3 complex through less stable DRMs. Core was also associated with NS2 and the E1E2 complex through these unstable DRMs. We suggest that DRMs carrying this NS2-E1-E2-NS3-4A-NS5A-core complex may play a central role in HCV assembly initiation, potentially as an assembly platform.",PubMed
Micropatterned Viral Membrane Clusters for Antiviral Drug Evaluation.,2019,10.1021/acsami.9b01724,30855935,ACS applied materials & interfaces,"The function of biological nanoparticles, such as membrane-enveloped viral particles, is often enhanced when the particles form higher-order supramolecular assemblies. While there is intense interest in developing biomimetic platforms that recapitulate these collective properties, existing platforms are limited to mimicking individual virus particles. Here, we present a micropatterning strategy to print linker molecules selectively onto bioinert surfaces, thereby enabling controlled tethering of biomimetic viral particle clusters across defined geometric patterns. By controlling the linker concentration, it is possible to tune the density of tethered particles within clusters while enhancing the signal intensity of encapsulated fluorescent markers. Time-resolved tracking of pore formation and membrane lysis revealed that an antiviral peptide can disturb clusters of the membrane-enclosed particles akin to the targeting of individual viral particles. This platform is broadly useful for evaluating the performance of membrane-active antiviral drug candidates, whereas the micropatterning strategy can be applied to a wide range of biological nanoparticles and other macromolecular entities.",PubMed

Haemolysis and aggregation studies revealed that there were no lysis and aggregation in WBC, RBC and platelets. In-vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the nanoparticles in Glioma, Neuro2a and Hela cells showed that ASNPs are non toxic.

Re-directing bacterial microcompartment systems to enhance recombinant expression of lysis protein E from bacteriophage ϕX174 in Escherichia coli.,2017,10.1186/s12934-017-0685-x,28446197,Microbial cell factories,"Recombinant expression of toxic proteins remains a challenging problem. One potential method to shield toxicity and thus improve expression of these proteins is to encapsulate them within protein compartments to sequester them away from their targets. Many bacteria naturally produce so-called bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) in which enzymes comprising a biosynthetic pathway are encapsulated in a proteinaeous shell, which is in part thought to shield the cells from the toxicity of reaction intermediates. As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to encapsulate toxic, lysis protein E (E) from bacteriophage ϕX174 inside recombinant BMCs to enhance its expression and achieve higher yields during downstream purification.",PubMed
A novel method to recover inclusion body protein from recombinant E. coli fed-batch processes based on phage ΦX174-derived lysis protein E.,2017,10.1007/s00253-017-8281-x,28429059,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,"Production of recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies is an important strategy in the production of technical enzymes and biopharmaceutical products. So far, protein from inclusion bodies has been recovered from the cell factory through mechanical or chemical disruption methods, requiring additional cost-intensive unit operations. We describe a novel method that is using a bacteriophage-derived lysis protein to directly recover inclusion body protein from Escherichia coli from high cell density fermentation process: The recombinant inclusion body product is expressed by using a mixed feed fed-batch process which allows expression tuning via adjusting the specific uptake rate of the inducing substrate. Then, bacteriophage ΦX174-derived lysis protein E is expressed to induce cell lysis. Inclusion bodies in empty cell envelopes are harvested via centrifugation of the fermentation broth. A subsequent solubilization step reveals the recombinant protein. The process was investigated by analyzing the impact of fermentation conditions on protein E-mediated cell lysis as well as cell lysis kinetics. Optimal cell lysis efficiencies of 99% were obtained with inclusion body titers of >2.0 g/l at specific growth rates higher 0.12 h",PubMed
Endogenous RNase inhibitor contributes to stability of RNA in crude cell lysates: Applicability to RT-qPCR.,2016,10.1016/j.ab.2016.08.011,27544650,Analytical biochemistry,"Crude cell lysates are increasingly used as input for direct analysis by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly for high-throughput applications. We previously demonstrated that a simple buffer containing a non-ionic detergent can serve as an inexpensive alternative to commercial cell-lysis reagents for the preparation of RT-qPCR-ready cell lysates; addition of an exogenous RNase inhibitor (RI) to the lysis buffer was found to be unnecessary to maintain RNA stability in cell lysates either freshly prepared or previously stored frozen at -80 °C. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the stability of RNA observed in our cell lysates is due to the presence of the endogenous RI. Furthermore, we have established the generalizability and applicability of this phenomenon by evaluating lysates prepared from cell lines commonly used in virology (A549, HeLa, MDCK, and Vero). Awareness of the mechanism underlying RNA stability may engender greater confidence in generating cell lysates for RT-qPCR without relying on addition of exogenous RI (a substantial cost-saving benefit) and encourage appropriate practices for handling and storage of samples.",PubMed
Kinetics of infected insect cell osmolysis and enhanced protein release using a modified disruption method.,2016,10.1007/s00449-016-1648-z,27435225,Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,"We have studied and characterized a cell disruption method to produce a protein extract from recombinant Baculovirus infected insect cells based on osmotic lysis. Cell lysis kinetics were measured during a 24-h incubation in lysis buffer and resulting data sets were curve fitted to a hyperbola, visually similar to the Michaelis-Menten curve, to determine the maximum concentration of released protein and the time required to reach equilibrium. Effect of parameters such as pH, ionic strength and infection phase were evaluated, and based on fittings optimal protein release conditions were obtained for total cell protein as well as the recombinant protein, HPV 16 L1. It was demonstrated that pH and the phase of infection can vastly influence the amount of release while ionic strength only effects the time required to achieve equilibrium in protein release. Osmolysis can be a mild, yet effective method to release recombinant protein with high recovery levels and hence can be used in capacities where stringent criteria regarding contamination with surfactant or non-cytoplasmic contents are observed.",PubMed
Delta-24-RGD Induces Cytotoxicity of Glioblastoma Spheroids in Three Dimensional PEG Microwells.,2015,10.1109/TNB.2015.2499312,26661633,IEEE transactions on nanobioscience,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor, with 12-15 months median survival time despite current treatment efforts. Among the alternative treatment approaches that have gained acceptance over the last decade is the use of replication-competent oncolytic adenoviruses, which are promising due to their relatively low toxicity and tumor-specific targeting. Three-dimensional (3D) tumor models can mimic the physiological microenvironment of GBM tumors and provide valuable information about the interaction between tumor cells and adenoviruses. Therefore, robust in vitro 3D tumor models are critical to investigate the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and explore the cytotoxicity effect of the adenovirus on tumor cells. In this study, we used a hydrogel microwell platform to generate in vitro 3D GBM spheroids and studied their interactions with the Delta-24-RGD adenovirus. The results showed that the cultured 3D spheroids were successfully infected by the Delta-24-RGD. A significant cell lysis was observed. Cell viability was decreased approximately 37%, 54% and 65% with 10, 50, and 100 MOIs, respectively. The infection of the Delta-24-RGD was found more effective on 3D spheroids when compared to 2D monolayer cell culture. These results implicate that our hydrogel microwell platform could provide a promising 3D model to investigate the oncolytic potential of the viruses in vitro.",PubMed
A Novel Bacteriophage Targeting Cronobacter sakazakii Is a Potential Biocontrol Agent in Foods.,2016,10.1128/AEM.01827-15,26497465,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Cronobacter sakazakii is an important pathogen that causes high mortality in infants. Due to its occasional antibiotic resistance, a bacteriophage approach might be an alternative effective method for the control of this pathogen. To develop a novel biocontrol agent using bacteriophages, the C. sakazakii-infecting phage CR5 was newly isolated and characterized. Interestingly, this phage exhibited efficient and relatively durable host lysis activity. In addition, a specific gene knockout study and subsequent complementation experiment revealed that this phage infected the host strain using the bacterial flagella. The complete genome sequence analysis of phage CR5 showed that its genome contains 223,989 bp of DNA, including 231 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and it has a G+C content of 50.06%. The annotated ORFs were classified into six functional groups (structure, packaging, host lysis, DNA manipulation, transcription, and additional functions); no gene was found to be related to virulence or toxin or lysogen formation, but >80% of the predicted ORFs are unknown. In addition, a phage proteomic analysis using SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) revealed that seven phage structural proteins are indeed present, supporting the ORF predictions. To verify the potential of this phage as a biocontrol agent against C. sakazakii, it was added to infant formula milk contaminated with a C. sakazakii clinical isolate or food isolate, revealing complete growth inhibition of the isolates by the addition of phage CR5 when the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 10(5).",PubMed
Herpes simplex virus clearance during purification of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 vector.,2014,10.1089/humc.2014.060,25357151,Human gene therapy. Clinical development,"Gene delivery vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) have potential utility for treatment of many genetic disorders. Current AAV vector manufacturing methods employ helper viruses to deliver functions needed to produce replication-defective recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors, and clearance of infectious helper virus from the drug substance is essential for ensuring the safety of rAAV-based therapies. We have developed a manufacturing method for the production of rAAV vectors using a recombinant herpes simplex virus type 1 (rHSV) complementation system in suspension baby hamster kidney cells. The manufacturing process includes three primary unit operations, detergent lysis of the cell harvest and two downstream column chromatography steps, which achieve viral clearance. These unit operations inactivate and remove HSV, including replication-competent HSV present at low levels in rHSV helper stocks. Here we report results quantifying the reduction in HSV achieved during rAAV vector purification. Clearance of HSV was at least 6.84 log10 with 1% Triton X-100, 4.34 log10 with CIM Q column chromatography, and 2.86 log10 with AVB affinity chromatography. Combined, these three orthogonal methods achieved clearance of at least 14.04 log10 of HSV. The total input quantity of rHSV in a 100-liter production batch is approximately 1.2×10(12) plaque-forming units (pfu), and after purification, the concentration of residual rHSV in the resulting drug substance of approximately 450 ml would be less than 2.42×10(-5) pfu/ml. A rAAV vector produced using this method was used in a clinical trial in which subjects receive up to 100 intramuscular injections of 1.35 ml each, which would contain a maximum of 3.27×10(-3) pfu of HSV. These results support the safety of rAAV vectors produced using our rHSV complementation method.",PubMed

Soil samples were collected in March 2013 during a survey of cherry orchards in Chelan County, WA; these historically suffer from cherry rasp leaf disease, caused by Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) (genus Cheravirus). Soil samples were transported to the WSDA nematology laboratory in Prosser, WA, where 250-cc subsamples were processed using sucrose centrifugal flotation (1). Dagger nematodes were hand-picked and stored in 0.1% sodium chloride before being sent to the USDA-ARS Nematology Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, for morphological and molecular identification.

In this study we analyzed quantitative host protein alterations in nuclei-enriched fractions from multiple primary human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cells infected by an H1N1 influenza A virus (A/PR/8/34). We first developed an effective detergent-free nuclear lysis method that was coupled with in-solution digestion and LC-MS/MS. Using SILAC, we identified 837 HBAE nuclear proteins in three different donors and compared their responses to infection at 24 h. Some proteins were altered in all three donors, of which 94 were up-regulated and 13 were down-regulated by at least 1.5-fold. Many of these up-regulated proteins clustered into purine biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein modification. Down-regulated proteins were not associated with any specific pathways or processes. These findings further our understanding of cellular processes that are altered in response to influenza in primary epithelial cells and may be beneficial in the search for host proteins that may be targeted for antiviral therapy.",PubMed

Although exposure to many detergents, such as Triton X-100 and Empigen, results in lysis of VLP membranes, VLPs appeared resistant to complete membrane lysis by a significant number of detergents, including Tween 20, Tween 80, Lubrol, and Saponin. VLPs maintained their structural integrity after exposure to Tween 20 at concentrations up to 500-fold above its CMC. Remarkably, VLPs containing immature cores composed of unprocessed (uncleaved) Gag polyprotein were significantly more resistant to detergent lysis than VLPs with mature cores.

Identification of protein interacting partners using tandem affinity purification.,2012,10.3791/3643,22395237,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"A critical and often limiting step in understanding the function of host and viral proteins is the identification of interacting cellular or viral protein partners. There are many approaches that allow the identification of interacting partners, including the yeast two hybrid system, as well as pull down assays using recombinant proteins and immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins followed by mass spectrometry identification(1). Recent studies have highlighted the utility of double-affinity tag mediated purification, coupled with two specific elution steps in the identification of interacting proteins. This approach, termed Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP), was initially used in yeast(2,3) but more recently has been adapted to use in mammalian cells(4-8). As proof-of-concept we have established a tandem affinity purification (TAP) method using the well-characterized eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E(9,10).The cellular translation factor eIF4E is a critical component of the cellular eIF4F complex involved in cap-dependent translation initiation(10). The TAP tag used in the current study is composed of two Protein G units and a streptavidin binding peptide separated by a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence. The TAP tag used in the current study is composed of two Protein G units and a streptavidin binding peptide separated by a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage sequence(8). To forgo the need for the generation of clonal cell lines, we developed a rapid system that relies on the expression of the TAP-tagged bait protein from an episomally maintained plasmid based on pMEP4 (Invitrogen). Expression of tagged murine eIF4E from this plasmid was controlled using the cadmium chloride inducible metallothionein promoter. Lysis of the expressing cells and subsequent affinity purification via binding to rabbit IgG agarose, TEV protease cleavage, binding to streptavidin linked agarose and subsequent biotin elution identified numerous proteins apparently specific to the eIF4E pull-down (when compared to control cell lines expressing the TAP tag alone). The identities of the proteins were obtained by excision of the bands from 1D SDS-PAGE and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry. The identified components included the known eIF4E binding proteins eIF4G and 4EBP-1. In addition, other components of the eIF4F complex, of which eIF4E is a component were identified, namely eIF4A and Poly-A binding protein. The ability to identify not only known direct binding partners as well as secondary interacting proteins, further highlights the utility of this approach in the characterization of proteins of unknown function.",PubMed

Lytic myophage Abp53 encodes several proteins similar to those encoded by host Acinetobacter baumannii and phage phiKO2.,2011,10.1128/AEM.05116-11,21821767,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an important Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial infections. The emergence of multiple-drug-resistant A. baumannii isolates has increased in recent years. Directed toward phage therapy, a lytic phage of A. baumannii, designated Abp53, was isolated from a sputum sample in this study. Abp53 has an isometric head and a contractile tail with tail fibers (belonging to Myoviridae), a latent period of about 10 min, and a burst size of approximately 150 PFU per infected cell. Abp53 could completely lyse 27% of the A. baumannii isolates tested, which were all multiple drug resistant, but not other bacteria. Mg(2+) enhanced the adsorption and productivity of, and host lysis by, Abp53. Twenty Abp53 virion proteins were visualized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a 47-kDa protein being the predicted major capsid protein. Abp53 has a double-stranded DNA genome of 95 kb. Sequence analyses of a 10-kb region revealed 8 open reading frames.

Role of DLP12 lysis genes in Escherichia coli biofilm formation.,2011,10.1099/mic.0.045161-0,21415116,"Microbiology (Reading, England)","Phages have recently been implicated as important in biofilm development, although the mechanisms whereby phages impact biofilms remain unclear. One defective lambdoid phage carried by Escherichia coli K-12 is DLP12. Among the genes found in DLP12 are essD, ybcS and rzpD/rzoD, which are homologues of the Lambda phage genes encoding cell-lysis proteins (S, R and Rz/Rz(1)). The role that these DLP12 lysis genes play in biofilm formation was examined in deletion mutants of E. coli PHL628, a curli-overproducing, biofilm-forming K-12 derivative. Strains lacking essD, ybcS and rzpD/rzoD were unable to form wild-type biofilms. While all mutants were compromised in attachment to abiotic surfaces and aggregated less well than the wild-type, the effect of the essD knockout on biofilm formation was less dramatic than that of deleting ybcS or rzpD/rzoD. These results were consistent with electron micrographs of the mutants, which showed a decreased number of curli fibres on cell surfaces. Also consistent with this finding, we observed that expression from the promoter of csgB, which encodes the curli subunits, was downregulated in the mutants. As curli production is transcriptionally downregulated in response to cell wall stress, we challenged the mutants with SDS and found them to be more sensitive to the detergent than the wild-type. We also examined the release of (14)C-labelled peptidoglycan from the mutants and found that they did not lose labelled peptidoglycan to the same extent as the wild-type. Given that curli production is known to be suppressed by N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate (NAG-6P), a metabolite produced during peptidoglycan recycling, we deleted nagK, the N-acetylglucosamine kinase gene, from the lysis mutants and found that this restored curli production. This suggested that deletion of the lysis genes affected cell wall status, which was transduced to the curli operon by NAG-6P via an as yet unknown mechanism. These observations provide evidence that the S, R and Rz/Rz(1) gene homologues encoded by DLP12 are not merely genetic junk, but rather play an important, though undefined, role in cell wall maintenance.",PubMed

Strand transfer and elongation of HIV-1 reverse transcription is facilitated by cell factors in vitro.,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0013229,20949087,PloS one,"Recent work suggests a role for multiple host factors in facilitating HIV-1 reverse transcription. Previously, we identified a cellular activity which increases the efficiency of HIV-1 reverse transcription in vitro. Here, we describe aspects of the activity which shed light on its function. The cellular factor did not affect synthesis of strong-stop DNA but did improve downstream DNA synthesis. The stimulatory activity was isolated by gel filtration in a single fraction of the exclusion volume. Velocity-gradient purified HIV-1, which was free of detectable RNase activity, showed poor reverse transcription efficiency but was strongly stimulated by partially purified cell proteins. Hence, the cell factor(s) did not inactivate an RNase activity that might degrade the viral genomic RNA and block completion of reverse transcription. Instead, the cell factor(s) enhanced first strand transfer and synthesis of late reverse transcription suggesting it stabilized the reverse transcription complex. The factor did not affect lysis of HIV-1 by Triton X-100 in the endogenous reverse transcription (ERT) system, and ERT reactions with HIV-1 containing capsid mutations, which varied the biochemical stability of viral core structures and impeded reverse transcription in cells, showed no difference in the ability to be stimulated by the cell factor(s) suggesting a lack of involvement of the capsid in the in vitro assay. In addition, reverse transcription products were found to be resistant to exogenous DNase I activity when the active fraction was present in the ERT assay. These results indicate that the cell factor(s) may improve reverse transcription by facilitating DNA strand transfer and DNA synthesis. It also had a protective function for the reverse transcription products, but it is unclear if this is related to improved DNA synthesis.",PubMed

Purification and functional characterization of phiX174 lysis protein E.,2009,10.1021/bi900469g,19379010,Biochemistry,"Two classes of bacteriophages, the single-stranded DNA Microviridae and the single-stranded RNA Alloleviviridae, accomplish lysis by expressing ""protein antibiotics"", or polypeptides that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. Previously, we have provided genetic and physiological evidence that E, a 91-amino acid membrane protein encoded by the prototype microvirus, varphiX174, is a specific inhibitor of the translocase MraY, an essential membrane-embedded enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the murein precursor, Lipid I, from UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide and the lipid carrier, undecaprenol phosphate. Here we report the first purification of E, which has been refractory to overexpression because of its lethality to Escherichia coli. Moreover, using a fluorescently labeled analogue of the sugar-nucleotide substrate, we demonstrate that E acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of detergent-solubilized MraY, with respect to both soluble and lipid substrates. In addition, we show that the E sensitivity of five MraY mutant proteins, produced from alleles selected for resistance to E, can be correlated to the apparent affinities determined by in vivo multicopy suppression experiments. These results are inconsistent with previous reports that E inhibited membrane-embedded MraY but not the detergent-solubilized enzyme, which led to a model in which E functions by binding MraY and blocking the formation of an essential heteromultimeric complex involving MraY and other murein biosynthesis enzymes. We discuss a new model in which E binds to MraY at a site composed of the two transmembrane domains within which the E resistance mutations map and the fact that the result of this binding is a conformational change that inactivates the enzyme.",PubMed

Because 2nd and 3rd generation nucleotide sequencers do not rely on molecular cloning of viral DNA, there is a need to develop methods for isolating highly pure DNA from these viruses. The cell-associated alphaherpesvirus Marek's disease virus (MDV-1) was chosen as a test virus for the development of such methodologies. The genomes of six MDV-1 strains have previously been sequenced using both Sanger dideoxy sequencing and 454 Life Sciences pyrosequencing. These genomes largely represent cell culture adapted strains due to the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of DNA from true low passage isolates. There are clear advantages in analyzing MDV-1 virus taken directly from infected tissues or low passage isolates since serial passage attenuates the virus. Procedures using an ATP-dependent exonuclease and Phi29 DNA polymerase to degrade host DNA selectively and amplify MDV-1 DNA enzymatically from total DNA preps were attempted without much success. Ultimately, however, a protocol was developed for purification of low passage MDV-1 DNA from infected avian fibroblasts. The method builds upon and extends available protocols based on hypotonic lysis to release virus particles followed by micrococcal nuclease treatment to degrade cellular DNA. Intact high-molecular weight viral DNA is purified away from an excess of degraded cellular DNA using polyethylene glycol precipitation. 454-based pyrosequencing of viral DNA purified in this manner has generated data containing as little as 2.3% host sequence.

Here we use electron microscopy and single-particle analysis to characterize structures formed by the bacteriophage lambda holin (S105) in vitro. In non-ionic or mild zwitterionic detergents, purified S105, but not the lysis-defective variant S105A52V, forms rings of at least two size classes, the most common having inner and outer diameters of 8.5 and 23 nm respectively, and containing approximately 72 S105 monomers. The height of these rings, 4 nm, closely matches the thickness of the lipid bilayer. The central channel is of unprecedented size for channels formed by integral membrane proteins, consistent with the non-specific nature of holin-mediated membrane permeabilization. S105 present in detergent-solubilized rings and in inverted membrane vesicles showed similar sensitivities to proteolysis and cysteine-specific modification, suggesting that the rings are representative of the lethal holes formed by S105 to terminate the infection cycle and initiate lysis.",PubMed
Ingestion without inactivation of bacteriophages by Tetrahymena.,2008,10.1111/j.1550-7408.2008.00316.x,18460158,The Journal of eukaryotic microbiology,"Tetrahymena has been shown to ingest and inactivate bacteriophages, such as T4, in co-incubation experiments. In this study, Tetrahymena thermophila failed to inactivate phages PhiX174 and MS2 in co-incubations, although PhiX174 were ingested by T. thermophila, as demonstrated by: (1) recovery at defecation in a pulse-chase experiment, (2) recovery from Tetrahymena by detergent lysis, and (3) transmission electron microscopy. We conclude, therefore, that the phages must be digestion-resistant. Internalized PhiX174 were further shown to be partially protected from lethal damage by ultraviolet (UV) C and UVB irradiation. Finally, ingested PhiX174 were shown to be rapidly transported through buffer in a horizontal swimming, race tube-like assay. The transport and protection of phages may confer evolutionary advantages that explain the acquisition of digestion-resistance by some phages.",PubMed
A simplified method for the extraction of baculoviral DNA for PCR analysis: a practical application.,2008,10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.11.004,18242721,Journal of virological methods,"There are two major strategies to genetically modify baculoviruses. One uses a bacmid-based system which replicates in Escherichia coli using a bacterial origin of replication. The other employs a transfer vector and viral DNA which are co-transfected into insect cells and utilise host enzyme-mediated homologous recombination. Putative recombinants are then typically screened by plaque assay. The bacmid system is more convenient, but it requires a number of complex construction and isolation steps to obtain the correct bacmid genome. Generally, the transfer vector method is preferable when only a small number of genetic modifications are required. In this study a rapid and reliable method was developed to extract baculovirus DNA for PCR analysis from cultured insect cells. Briefly, viral DNA was isolated in three steps: SDS lysis, chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The method was tested for direct screening of recombinant viruses in plaque assays. Contrary to previous reports, baculovirus DNA was isolated directly from viral plaques and successfully analysed by PCR. No prior amplification of the virus by passage in tissue culture was necessary. The major advantage of this method was a reduction in assay times from a few days to a few hours. Moreover, this method is very convenient for detecting baculoviruses in cell culture: cross-contamination within viral stocks, monitoring mixed viral infection and confirmation of viral genomic integrity.",PubMed
Specific and efficient cleavage of fusion proteins by recombinant plum pox virus NIa protease.,2008,10.1016/j.pep.2007.10.008,18024078,Protein expression and purification,"Site-specific proteases are the most popular kind of enzymes for removing the fusion tags from fused target proteins. Nuclear inclusion protein a (NIa) proteases obtained from the family Potyviridae have become promising due to their high activities and stringencies of sequences recognition. NIa proteases from tobacco etch virus (TEV) and tomato vein mottling virus (TVMV) have been shown to process recombinant proteins successfully in vitro. In this report, recombinant PPV (plum pox virus) NIa protease was employed to process fusion proteins with artificial cleavage site in vitro. Characteristics such as catalytic ability and affecting factors (salt, temperature, protease inhibitors, detergents, and denaturing reagents) were investigated. Recombinant PPV NIa protease expressed and purified from Escherichia coli demonstrated efficient and specific processing of recombinant GFP and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, with site F (N V V V H Q black triangle down A) for PPV NIa protease artificially inserted between the fusion tags and the target proteins. Its catalytic capability is similar to those of TVMV and TEV NIa protease. Recombinant PPV NIa protease reached its maximal proteolytic activity at approximately 30 degrees C. Salt concentration and only one of the tested protease inhibitors had minor influences on the proteolytic activity of PPV NIa protease. Recombinant PPV NIa protease was resistant to self-lysis for at least five days.",PubMed
Enterobacter sakazakii bacteriophages can prevent bacterial growth in reconstituted infant formula.,2007,10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.10.029,17196280,International journal of food microbiology,"Reconstituted infant formula has been implicated in outbreaks of Enterobacter sakazakii infections, causing high mortality and serious sequelae. Current prevention methods appear to be insufficient to ensure that such foods are free of E. sakazakii. In this study, the usefulness of bacteriophages for biocontrol of E. sakazakii was investigated. Of a total of six new E. sakazakii phages isolated from sewage and UV irradiated cultures, two were selected for further study by electron microscopy, DNA restriction analysis and SDS-PAGE of structural proteins. Purified phages were used to control bacterial growth in broth medium and reconstituted infant formula. Both phages effectively prevented development of E. sakazakii in formula at various temperatures (12, 24 and 37 degrees C), the efficiency of which was dependent upon intrinsic lysis properties and the applied phage concentration. We conclude that application of specific bacteriophages may provide a means for efficient prevention of E. sakazakii infection through reconstituted infant formula.",PubMed
"Mammalian reovirus, a nonfusogenic nonenveloped virus, forms size-selective pores in a model membrane.",2006,10.1073/pnas.0605835103,17053074,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"During cell entry, reovirus particles with a diameter of 70-80 nm must penetrate the cellular membrane to access the cytoplasm. The mechanism of penetration, without benefit of membrane fusion, is not well characterized for any such nonenveloped animal virus. Lysis of RBCs is an in vitro assay for the membrane perforation activity of reovirus; however, the mechanism of lysis has been unknown. In this report, osmotic-protection experiments using PEGs of different sizes revealed that reovirus-induced lysis of RBCs occurs osmotically, after formation of small size-selective lesions or ""pores."" Consistent results were obtained by monitoring leakage of fluorophore-tagged dextrans from the interior of resealed RBC ghosts. Gradient fractionations showed that whole virus particles, as well as the myristoylated fragment mu1N that is released from particles, are recruited to RBC membranes in association with pore formation. We propose that formation of small pores is a discrete, intermediate step in the reovirus membrane-penetration pathway, which may be shared by other nonenveloped animal viruses.",PubMed
Evaluation of viral clearance in the production of HPV-16 L1 virus-like particles purified from insect cell cultures.,2006,10.1016/j.biologicals.2005.11.008,16500115,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,"Biopharmaceutical products produced from cell cultures have a potential for viral contamination from cell sources or from adventitious introduction during production. The objective of this study was to assess viral clearance in the production of insect cell-derived recombinant human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 type L1 virus-like particles (VLPs). We selected Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and minute virus of mice (MVM) as relevant viruses to achieve the aim of this study. A downstream process for the production of purified HPV-16 L1 VLPs consisted of detergent lysis of harvested cells, sonication, sucrose cushion centrifugation, and cesium chloride (CsCl) equilibrium density centrifugation. The capacity of each purification/treatment step to clear viruses was expressed as reduction factor by measuring the difference in log virus infectivity of sample pools before and after each process. As a result, detergent treatment (0.5% v/v, Nonidet P-40/phosphate-buffered saline) was effective for inactivating enveloped viruses such as JEV and BVDV, but no significant reduction (< 1.0 log(10)) was observed in the non-enveloped MVM. The CsCl equilibrium density centrifugation was fairly effective for separating all three relevant adventitious viruses with different CsCl buoyant density from that of HPV-16 L1 VLPs (JEV, BVDV, and MVM = 4.30, 3.10, > or = 4.40 log(10) reductions). Given the study conditions we used, overall cumulative reduction factors for clearance of JEV, BVDV, and MVM were > or = 10.50, > or = 9.20, and > or = 6.40 log(10) in 150 ml of starting cell cultures, respectively.",PubMed
Improved HIV-1 viral load determination based on reverse transcriptase activity recovered from human plasma.,2005,10.1002/jmv.20360,15902697,Journal of medical virology,"A more sensitive version of ExaVir Load, a test that utilizes reverse transcriptase (RT) activity from virions in plasma to determine HIV-1 viral load, is described. The virions were immobilized on a gel that was washed, followed by lysis of the virions, elution of purified RT, and finally RT activity determination. The changes made to the original test were: (1) improved washing of the immobilized virions by addition of a non-lytic detergent to the wash buffer, (2) improved virion lysis procedure, including changes in salt, detergent and pH, (3) the use of larger sample volumes in the RT assay, and (4) prolonged RT reaction time. The alterations gave a tenfold increased sensitivity compared to the original version. The correlation between RT load by the current test and RNA PCR was the same as previously (r=0.90). Using colorimetric product detection, the average detection limit in a panel of 262 patient plasma from Stockholm was 0.5 fg RT/ml, corresponding to approximately 170 RNA copies/ml. None of 54 HIV-1 RNA negative samples exhibited RT. The amount of RT load positive samples were 19% for samples containing 50-400 RNA, 71% for samples with 400-1,500, and 100% among samples with >8,000 copies/ml (according to Roche Amplicor). The sensitivity could be increased further using fluorimetric detection. In conclusion, the modifications of the test described result in an important increase in sensitivity. It can now be regarded as a competitive alternative method for HIV viral load determinations.",PubMed
Evaluation of photolyase (Photosome) repair activity in human keratinocytes after a single dose of ultraviolet B irradiation using the comet assay.,2005,10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2004.11.022,15878115,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology","Photosome is constituted of photolyases included in liposomes. Photolyase is a bacterial enzyme that can repair ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in eukaryotic cells. A modified version of the alkaline comet assay has been set up to evaluate the repair activity of this enzyme after a single dose of UVB (312 nm, 0.06 J/cm2) in human keratinocytes. The formation of single strand breaks (SSB) induced by the UVA photoactivation of the enzyme (1.2 J/cm2) was inhibited by the pretreatment of the cells with 4 mM L-ergothioneine (ERT) during 30 min at 37 degrees C. To increase the sensitivity of the comet assay, an additional lysis was used with a buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.5%) and proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) for 60 min at 37 degrees C. Unrepaired CPD by photolyase were revealed by a second enzymatic treatment with T4 endonuclease V, a CPD specific glycosylase. UVB irradiation increased the SSB level in keratinocytes and additional T4NV treatment enhanced this SSB level by 1.5-2.0-fold confirming that CPD were the major base modifications generated by UVB irradiation. UVA-photoactivated Photosome repaired CPD lesions and decreased the SSB levels by 2.6-3.3-fold.

By means of film balance techniques lipid/peptide discrimination was found resulting in a lipid-rich and a peptide-rich phase. Quartz crystal microbalance and scanning force microscopy experiments led to the conclusion of a detergent-like mechanism of the gamma(1) peptide resulting in mixed lipid-peptide micelles with a molar ratio of 2.8:1. A monolayer adsorption with an ongoing lysis of membranes was found with gamma(1) peptide molecules interacting at membrane defects.",PubMed
Influences of chitinase gene deletion from BmNPV on the cell lysis and host liquefaction.,2005,10.1007/s00705-004-0458-9,15614431,Archives of virology,"A Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) mutant with chi- tinase gene (chiA) deletion (BmchiA-) was constructed.

The egfp gene expression under the control of the chiA promoter, in BmchiA- -infected BmN cells could be detected as early as 8 h p.i. The fluorescence reached its peak at 48 h p.i., and was prevalent until the cell lysis. Cytopathological comparison of the cells infected with wild type and mutant viruses showed that deletion of chiA could evidently delay the cell lysis. SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that the content of polyhedrin in BmchiA- -infected cells at 7 days p.i. was about 28% of the total cellular proteins, about 7% lower than that in wild-type BmNPV virus-infected cells.

Solubilization and delivery by GroEL of megadalton complexes of the lambda holin.,2004,10.1110/ps.04735104,15215521,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,"GroEL can solubilize membrane proteins by binding them in its hydrophobic cavity when detergent is removed by dialysis. The best-studied example is bacteriorhodopsin, which can bind in the GroEL chaperonin at two molecules per tetradecamer. Applying this approach to the holin and antiholin proteins of phage lambda, we find that both proteins are solubilized by GroEL, in an ATP-sensitive mode, but to vastly different extents. The antiholin product, S107, saturates the chaperonin at six molecules per tetradecameric complex, whereas the holin, S105, which is missing the two N-terminal residues of S107, forms a hyper-solubilization complex with up to 350 holin molecules per GroEL, or approximately 4 MDa of protein per 0.8 MDa tetradecamer. Gel filtration chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the existence of complexes of the predicted masses for both S105 and S107 solubilization. For S105, negatively stained electron microscopic images show structures consistent with protein shells of the holin assembled around the chaperonin tetradecamer. Importantly, S105 can be delivered rapidly and efficiently to artificial liposomes from these complexes. In these delivery experiments, the holin exhibits efficient membrane-permeabilizing activity. The S107 antiholin can block formation of the hypersolubilization complexes, suggesting that their formation is related to an oligomerization step intrinsic to holin function.",PubMed
Decontamination of surfaces by lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles.,2004,10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.02.010,15177166,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences","Cells and enzymes can be used to decontaminate soil, water supplies, personal equipment, weapons and hospital equipment that have been exposed to bacteria, toxins or viruses. One of the problems associated with the use of microorganisms and enzymes for decontamination purposes is that the presence of water is not acceptable for some applications such as electronic equipment. One way of circumventing this problem is to allow the enzyme to distribute between a water phase and an organic phase-containing surfactant and then use the encapsulated enzyme in reverse micelles directly into the device to be clean. Reverse micelles were used to deliver the enzyme (lysozyme) to the cell-surface interface. They serve as a way to increase the local concentration of lysozyme and decrease the amount of water delivered. Specifically, we explored the lysis by free lysozyme and lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis attached to steel, glass, and hydroxyapatite. These two bacteria have been selected because they are known to be pathogenic and because of their differences in cell wall structure. Lysozyme was added to the surfaces in either reverse micelles or as a free solution and was tested under conditions of stirring and no stirring. Stirring was implemented to study the interplay between mass transfer limitations and surface roughness. We have shown that free lysozyme or lysozyme encapsulated in reverse micelles is capable of decontaminating surfaces of different texture. Lysis of the cells is slower when the encapsulated enzyme is used but lysis is more complete.",PubMed
Rotavirus RRV associates with lipid membrane microdomains during cell entry.,2004,10.1016/j.virol.2004.02.018,15110534,Virology,"Rotavirus cell entry is a multistep process, not completely understood, which requires at least four interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this work, we investigated the role of the sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched lipid microdomains (rafts) in the entry of rotavirus strain RRV to MA104 cells. We found that ganglioside GM1, integrin subunits alpha2 and beta3, and the heat shock cognate protein 70 (hsc70), all of which have been implicated as rotavirus receptors, are associated with TX-100 and Lubrol WX detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Integrin subunits alpha2 and beta3 were found to be particularly enriched in DRMs resistant to lysis by Lubrol WX. When purified RRV particles were incubated with cells at 4 degrees C, about 10% of the total infectious virus was found associated with DRMs, and the DRM-associated virus increased to 37% in Lubrol-resistant membrane domains after 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C. The virus was excluded from DRMs if the cells were treated with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD). Immunoblot analysis of the viral proteins showed that the virus surface proteins became enriched in DRMs upon incubation at 37 degrees C, being almost exclusively localized in Lubrol-resistant DRMs after 60 min. These data suggest that detergent-resistant membrane domains play an important role in the cell entry of rotaviruses, which could provide a platform to facilitate the efficient interaction of the rotavirus receptors with the virus particle.",PubMed
A signal-arrest-release sequence mediates export and control of the phage P1 endolysin.,2004,10.1073/pnas.0400957101,15090650,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"The Lyz endolysin of bacteriophage P1 was found to cause lysis of the host without a holin. Induction of a plasmid-cloned lyz resulted in lysis, and the lytic event could be triggered prematurely by treatments that dissipate the proton-motive force. Instead of requiring a holin, export was mediated by an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) and required host sec function. Exported Lyz of identical SDS/PAGE mobility was found in both the membrane and periplasmic compartments, indicating that periplasmic Lyz was not generated by the proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-associated form. In gene fusion experiments, the Lyz TMD directed PhoA to both the membrane and periplasmic compartments, whereas the TMD of the integral membrane protein FtsI restricts Lyz to the membrane. Thus, the N-terminal domain of Lyz is both necessary and sufficient not only for export of this endolysin to the membrane but also for its release into the periplasm. The unusual N-terminal domain, rich in residues that are weakly hydrophobic, thus functions as a signal-arrest-release sequence, which first acts as a normal signal-arrest domain to direct the endolysin to the periplasm in membrane-tethered form and then allows it to be released as a soluble active enzyme in the periplasm. Examination of the protein sequences of related bacteriophage endolysins suggests that the presence of an N-terminal signal-arrest-release sequence is not unique to Lyz. These observations are discussed in relation to the role of holins in the control of host lysis by bacteriophage encoding a secretory endolysin.",PubMed

This particle, named PAV1, is lemon-shaped (120 nm x 80 nm), with a short tail terminated by fibers, and resembles the virus SSV1, the type member of the Fuselloviridae, isolated from Sulfolobus shibatae. Sensitivity of the virus-like particle to organic solvents and detergents suggested that the envelope of PAV1 may contain lipids in addition to proteins. It contains a double-stranded circular DNA of 18 kb which is also present in high copy number in a free form in the host cytoplasm. No integrated form of the PAV1 genome could be detected in the host chromosome. Under standard growth conditions, the host cells continuously release PAV1 particles into the culture supernatant without spontaneous lysis, with a maximum reached in the late stationary phase. UV, gamma irradiation, treatment with mitomycin C, and various physiological stresses had no effect on PAV1 production. Screening of a large number of Thermococcales isolates did not permit to find a sensitive host. These results suggest that PAV1 persists in the host strain in a stable carrier state rather than a prophage.",PubMed

The phage was specific for two related strains of L. plantarum, BI7 and its mutant (deficient in malolactate fermenting ability) MU45, which have been evaluated as starter cultures for controlled cucumber fermentation and as biocontrol microorganisms for minimally processed vegetable products. The phage genome of PhiJL-1 was sequenced to reveal a linear, double-stranded DNA (36.7 kbp). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profiles indicated that PhiJL-1 contains six structural proteins (28, 34, 45, 50, 61, and 76 kDa). Electron microscopy revealed that the phage has an isometric head (59 nm in diameter), a long non-contractile tail (182 nm in length and 11 nm in width), and a complex base plate. The phage belongs to the Bradley group B1 or Siphoviridae family. One-step growth kinetics of the phage showed that the latent period was 35 min, the rise period was 40 min, and the average burst size was 22 phage particles/infected cell. Phage particles (90%) adsorbed to the host cells 20 min after infection. Calcium supplementation (up to 30 mM CaCl(2)) in MRS media did not affect the first cycle of phage adsorption, but promoted rapid phage propagation and cell lysis in the infection cycle subsequent to adsorption. The D values of PhiJL-1 at pH 6.5 were estimated to be 2.7 min at 70 degrees C and 0.2 min at 80 degrees C by a thermal inactivation experiment.

Aggregation of influenza virus ribonucleocapsids at low pH.,2002,10.1016/s0168-1702(02)00028-x,12034481,Virus research,"Uncoating of influenza occurs in endosomes where the acid environment is instrumental in membrane fusion and the dissociation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) from matrix protein by the action of the hemagglutinin and M2 protein ion channels, respectively. Earlier studies have shown that low pH treatment results in the release of M1 protein from RNP. To obtain RNP free of M1 protein, we attempted to isolate RNP by velocity sedimentation on pH 5 glycerol gradients; however, the RNP sedimented as pellets under centrifugation conditions that had previously resolved RNP on neutral gradients. The increase in sedimentation rate occurred between pH 5.6 and 6.0 and was reversible for a portion of the RNP on raising the pH to neutrality. RNP isolated from infected cells or virions sedimented on acidification and was seen to form clumps visible by electron microscopy. If acidification preceded NP40 detergent lysis, virion RNP appeared to be released as genomic complexes. The pH threshold for viral membrane fusion was 5.8 indicating that the same pH condition also resulted in aggregation of RNP. Because exposure of virions to pH 5 occurs during uncoating in endosomes and is essential for infectivity, it is possible that low pH-induced RNP aggregation may facilitate aspects of viral uncoating such as dissociation of RNP from M1 or transport of genomes to the nucleus.",PubMed
A null mutation in the gene encoding the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL37 polypeptide abrogates virus maturation.,2001,10.1128/JVI.75.21.10259-10271.2001,11581394,Journal of virology,"The tegument is an integral and essential structural component of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) virion. The UL37 open reading frame of HSV-1 encodes a 120-kDa virion polypeptide which is a resident of the tegument. To analyze the function of the UL37-encoded polypeptide a null mutation was generated in the gene encoding this protein. In order to propagate this mutant virus, transformed cell lines that express the UL37 gene product in trans were produced. The null mutation was transferred into the virus genome using these complementing cell lines. A mutant virus designated KDeltaUL37 was isolated based on its ability to form plaques on the complementing cell line but not on nonpermissive (noncomplementing) Vero cells. This virus was unable to grow in Vero cells; therefore, UL37 encodes an essential function of the virus. The mutant virus KDeltaUL37 produced capsids containing DNA as judged by sedimentation analysis of extracts derived from infected Vero cells. Therefore, the UL37 gene product is not required for DNA cleavage or packaging. The UL37 mutant capsids were tagged with the smallest capsid protein, VP26, fused to green fluorescent protein. This fusion protein decorates the capsid shell and consequently the location of the capsid and the virus particle can be visualized in living cells. Late in infection, KDeltaUL37 capsids were observed to accumulate at the periphery of the nucleus as judged by the concentration of fluorescence around this organelle. Fluorescence was also observed in the cytoplasm in large puncta. Fluorescence at the plasma membrane, which indicated maturation and egress of virions, was observed in wild-type-infected cells but was absent in KDeltaUL37-infected cells. Ultrastructural analysis of thin sections of infected cells revealed clusters of DNA-containing capsids in the proximity of the inner nuclear membrane. Occasionally enveloped capsids were observed between the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Clusters of unenveloped capsids were also observed in the cytoplasm of KDeltaUL37-infected cells. Enveloped virions, which were observed in the cytoplasm of wild-type-infected cells, were never detected in the cytoplasm of KDeltaUL37-infected cells. Crude cell fractionation of infected cells using detergent lysis demonstrated that two-thirds of the UL37 mutant particles were associated with the nuclear fraction, unlike wild-type particles, which were predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction. These data suggest that in the absence of UL37, the exit of capsids from the nucleus is slowed. UL37 mutant particles can participate in the initial envelopment at the nuclear membrane, although this process may be impaired in the absence of UL37. Furthermore, the naked capsids deposited in the cytoplasm are unable to progress further in the morphogenesis pathway, which suggests that UL37 is also required for egress and reenvelopment. Therefore, the UL37 gene product plays a key role in the early stages of the maturation pathway that give rise to an infectious virion.",PubMed

The KpnI fragment was considered as the genetic element responsible for the lysis gene of L. plantarum bacteriophage. The cloned fragment in pUC19 was hybridized to a 9.4-kb fragment generated by KpnI digestion of SC 921 as a probe. This confirmed that the fragment in pUC19 originated from phage DNA.

Specific inhibitors prevent proteolytic degradation of recombinant proteins expressed in High Five cells.,2001,10.2144/01304st04,11314261,BioTechniques,"The insect cell line BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High Five) is frequently used to express recombinant proteins in large amounts using the baculovirus expression system. However, extensive proteolytic degradation of recombinant proteins is often encountered. Furthermore, we have observed that recombinant proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE in agreement with poly-ubiquitinated forms of the protein, suggesting a ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathway. Here, we describe a systematic study unraveling the effect of adding proteasome inhibitors or specific protease inhibitors to the growth medium of High Five insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. Furthermore, protease inhibitors were added to the lysis buffer to establish the most efficient way to inhibit proteolytic activity after lysis of baculovirus-infected cells expressing recombinant proteins. We conclude that a combination of adding protease inhibitors to the growth medium and to the lysis buffer minimizes the proteolytic activity in High Five cells. The most efficient protease inhibitors were E-64 in the growth medium together with Leupeptin in the lysis buffer at concentrations higher than with available cocktails of inhibitors. The optimal treatment of High Five cells is different from the optimal treatment of Sf9 cells. For proteins susceptible to ubiquitinylation, a treatment of insect cell cultures with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (LLL) leads to a considerable reduction of the yield of production of recombinant protein.",PubMed
"Revisiting the lysogenization control of bacteriophage lambda. Identification and characterization of a new host component, HflD.",2001,10.1074/jbc.M011699200,11278968,The Journal of biological chemistry,"Upon infection to the Escherichia coli cell, the genome of bacteriophage lambda either replicates to form new progenies (lytic growth) or integrates into the host chromosome (lysogenization). The lambda CII protein is a key determinant in the lysis-lysogeny decision. It is a short-lived transcription activator for the lambda genes essential for lysogeny establishment. In this study, we isolated a new class of hfl (high frequency lysogenization) mutants of E. coli, using a new selection for enhancement of CII-stimulated transcription. The gene affected was termed hflD, which encodes a protein of 213 amino acids. An hflD-disrupted mutant indeed showed an Hfl phenotype, indicating that HflD acts to down-regulate lysogenization. HflD is associated peripherally with the cytoplasmic membrane. Its interaction with CII was demonstrated in vitro using purified proteins as well as in vivo using the bacterial two-hybrid system. Pulse-chase examinations demonstrated that the HflD function is required for the rapid in vivo degradation of CII, although it interfered with FtsH-mediated CII proteolysis in an in vitro reaction system using detergent-solubilized components. We suggest that HflD is a factor that sequesters CII from the target promoters and recruits it to the membrane where the FtsH protease is localized.",PubMed
Quantification of in vitro retroviral replication using a one-tube real-time RT-PCR system incorporating direct RNA preparation.,2001,10.1016/s0166-0934(00)00259-7,11164496,Journal of virological methods,"The methodological and logistic benefits gained from assessing in vitro antiretroviral replication using one-tube real-time RT-PCR procedures are currently diminished by a continuing need for prior RNA isolation. We now report a simple and inexpensive modification of a commercially available one-tube RT-PCR assay, consisting of detergent-based virus lysis in the presence of a ribonuclease inhibitor, which can be used to directly quantify retroviral RNA levels in culture supernatant. This approach circumvents the potential loss of RNA inherent to RNA-isolation procedures based on prior extraction and demonstrates a dynamic range of at least 4 logs. Using in vitro culture systems incorporating either HIV-1 or FIV, we show that this ability to isolate retroviral RNA directly during the RT-PCR process can provide an equivalent alternative to one of the more time and resource-consuming steps in quantifying in vitro retroviral RNA levels.",PubMed
Escherichia coli strains blocked in Tat-dependent protein export exhibit pleiotropic defects in the cell envelope.,2001,10.1128/JB.183.1.139-144.2001,11114910,Journal of bacteriology,"The Tat system is a recently discovered protein export pathway that serves to translocate folded proteins, often containing redox cofactors, across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Here we report that tat strains are associated with a mutant cell septation phenotype, where chains of up to 10 cells are evident. Mutant strains are also hypersensitive to hydrophobic drugs and to lysis by lysozyme in the absence of EDTA, and they leak periplasmic enzymes, characteristics that are consistent with an outer membrane defect. Both phenotypes are similar to those displayed by strains carrying point mutations in the lpxC (envA) gene. The phenotype was not replicated by mutations affecting synthesis and/or activity of all known or predicted Tat substrates.",PubMed
[Construction and bioassay of secondary recombinant baculovirus with two foreign gene].,2000,,11051817,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,"Plasmid pAcLEneo which bears neomycin gene derived by the baculovirus IE1 promotor was digested and the gene was harvested. A transfer vector pAc34DZ2 in which the polyhedrin envelope gene has been inactivated by insertion of expression cassette of PIE1/neo was constructed by inserting the neo cassette into the SacI site of plasmid pAc34DZ1. We have constructed the polyhedrin positive recombinant virus (I) vAcPhBtT which was able to express Bt truncated endotoxin gene. In order to improve the insecticide efficiency of recombinant virus (I), an anti-neomycin recombinant virus (II) vAcPhBtTPE- was obtained by second co-transfection into the Sf9 cells with pAc34DZ2 and recombinant virus (I) DNA. Southern blot and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the recombinant virus (II) was still able to express the 80 kD Bt truncated delta-endotoxin, but did not express the 34 kD polyhedrin envelope protein. The recombinant virus (II) without envelope released virion faster than recombinant virus (I) after alkaline lysis. Bioassay was carried out using Spodoera exigua.

Dimerization between the holin and holin inhibitor of phage lambda.,2000,10.1128/JB.182.21.6075-6081.2000,11029427,Journal of bacteriology,"Holins are integral membrane proteins that control the access of phage-encoded muralytic enzymes, or endolysins, to the cell wall by the sudden formation of an uncharacterized homo-oligomeric lesion, or hole, in the membrane, at a precisely defined time. The timing of lambda-infected cell lysis depends solely on the 107 codon S gene, which encodes two proteins, S105 and S107, which are the holin and holin inhibitor, respectively. Here we report the results of biochemical and genetic studies on the interaction between the holin and the holin inhibitor. A unique cysteine at position 51, in the middle of the second transmembrane domain, is shown to cause the formation of disulfide-linked dimers during detergent membrane extraction. Forced oxidation of membranes containing S molecules also results in the formation of covalently linked dimers. This technique is used to demonstrate efficient dimeric interactions between S105 and S107. These results, coupled with the previous finding that the timing of lysis depends on the excess of the amount of S105 over S107, suggest a model in which the inhibitor functions by titrating out the effector in a stoichiometric fashion. This provides a basis for understanding two evolutionary advantages provided by the inhibitor system, in which the production of the inhibitor not only causes a delay in the timing of lysis, allowing the assembly of more virions, but also increases effective hole formation after triggering.",PubMed
Selective membrane permeabilization by the rotavirus VP5* protein is abrogated by mutations in an internal hydrophobic domain.,2000,10.1128/jvi.74.14.6368-6376.2000,10864647,Journal of virology,"Rotavirus infectivity is dependent on the proteolytic cleavage of the VP4 spike protein into VP8* and VP5* proteins. Proteolytically activated virus, as well as expressed VP5*, permeabilizes membranes, suggesting that cleavage exposes a membrane-interactive domain of VP5* which effects rapid viral entry. The VP5* protein contains a single long hydrophobic domain (VP5*-HD, residues 385 to 404) at an internal site. In order to address the role of the VP5*-HD in permeabilizing cellular membranes, we analyzed the entry of o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) into cells induced to express VP5* or mutated VP5* polypeptides. Following IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) induction, VP5* and VP5* truncations containing the VP5*-HD permeabilized cells to the entry and cleavage of ONPG, while VP8* and control proteins had no effect on cellular permeability. Expression of VP5* deletions containing residues 265 to 474 or 265 to 404 permeabilized cells; however, C-terminal truncations which remove the conserved GGA (residues 399 to 401) within the HD abolished membrane permeability. Site-directed mutagenesis of the VP5-HD further demonstrated a requirement for residues within the HD for VP5*-induced membrane permeability. Functional analysis of mutant VP5*s indicate that conserved glycines within the HD are required and suggest that a random coiled structure rather than the strictly hydrophobic character of the domain is required for permeability. Expressed VP5* did not alter bacterial growth kinetics or lyse bacteria following induction. Instead, VP5*-mediated size-selective membrane permeability, releasing 376-Da carboxyfluorescein but not 4-kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran from preloaded liposomes. These findings suggest that the fundamental role for VP5* in the rotavirus entry process may be to expose triple-layered particles to low [Ca](i), which uncoats the virus, rather than to effect the detergent-like lysis of early endosomal membranes.",PubMed
The usefulness of blood culture in diagnosing HIV-related systemic mycoses: evaluation of a manual lysis centrifugation method.,2000,10.1080/mmy.38.1.77.80,10746231,Medical mycology,"The results of 5034 blood cultures, implementing a lysis-centrifugation method with saponin, are summarized in this paper. Three hundred and twenty-two blood samples (6.3%) obtained from a pool of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients yielded fungi. Cryptococcus neoformans was isolated in 199 samples (3.95%), Histoplasma capsulatum in 95 (1.89%).

Purification of his-tagged proteins by immobilized chelate affinity chromatography: the benefits from the use of organic solvent.,2000,10.1006/prep.1999.1162,10648174,Protein expression and purification,"Recombinant proteins overexpressed in and purified from Escherichia coli contain impurities that are toxic in biological assays. The application of affinity purification procedures is often not sufficient to remove these toxic components. We here describe a simple and fast, one-step protocol to remove these impurities highly efficiently. Four recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli as His-tagged fusion proteins and purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA beads. Depending on the protein, the composition of the lysis buffer, and the washing protocol, various impurities appeared to be present in the purified protein preparations. Here we show how the use of 60% isopropanol during washing steps removed most of these contaminants from the end products. In addition to the removal of proteins that aspecifically adhere to the beads or to the tagged protein, this procedure was particularly useful in removing endotoxins. Moreover, we show that detergents such as NP-40, that are necessarily employed during lysis, are also efficiently removed. Finally, we show that proteins are able to refold correctly after isopropanol treatment. Thus, the resulting end products contain significantly less contaminating E. coli proteins, endotoxins, and detergents.",PubMed
Quantitation of adenovirus DNA and virus particles with the PicoGreen fluorescent Dye.,1999,10.1006/abio.1999.4282,10527527,Analytical biochemistry,"A microplate assay for the rapid quantitation of adenovirus DNA has been developed using the fluorescent dye PicoGreen, which selectively binds double-stranded DNA. The method was first applied to extracted adenoviral DNA and then extended to samples of intact, purified adenovirus after lysis of the viral capsid with the ionic detergent SDS. Utilizing the stoichiometric relationship between adenovirus DNA and intact particles, a physical particle count of intact virus is then derived for the sample. This PicoGreen-based assay has excellent reproducibility, linearity, and sensitivity. In its present form, this assay has a limit of quantitation of 10.3 ng/ml viral DNA, predicted to correspond to 2.6 x 10(8) virus particles/ml. This procedure was compared to a widely utilized spectroscopic method, in which samples are lysed with SDS and absorbance is read at 260 nm, and found to be 10- to 20-fold more sensitive. The dye binding assay also uses considerably less sample volume (<20%) than that needed for the spectroscopic method. Particle count values generated by the PicoGreen procedure are consistently lower (typically 1.5- to 2-fold) than this spectroscopic method. The applications and limitations of this method in the analysis of adenovirus samples are discussed.",PubMed
A simple and rapid method for preparation of viral DNA from cell associated cytomegalovirus.,1999,10.1016/s0166-0934(99)00058-0,10488769,Journal of virological methods,"In the field of human cytomegalovirus pathogenesis there is growing interest in analyzing recent clinical isolates rather than cell culture adapted laboratory strains. However, true low passage isolates are strictly cell associated prior to cell culture adaptation and only a minor fraction of cells are infected at low passage number. Both conditions hinder the preparation of pure viral DNA. To date, genetic analyses had been carried out mostly with supernatant associated cytomegalovirus. A rapid and simple method is described for preparation of viral DNA from low passage cell associated isolates with little cytopathogenic effect. The protocol is based on a combination of Triton X-100 lysis, nuclease treatment, and subsequent phenol chloroform extraction. Cellular background was reduced significantly to enable clear detection of all viral DNA fragments in restriction fragment length analysis. The method yielded DNA which was suitable for downstream applications like cloning of viral DNA fragments or transfection of genomic viral DNA. This method may facilitate genomic analyses of pathogenic cell associated recent cytomegalovirus isolates.",PubMed
Altered biological properties of cell membranes in Escherichia coli dnaA and seqA mutants.,1999,10.1007/s004380050019,10394913,Molecular & general genetics : MGG,"We present evidence that biological properties of cell membranes are altered in dnaA and seqA mutants of Escherichia coli relative to wild-type bacteria. We found that bacteriophage lambda forms extremely large plaques on the dnaA seqA double mutants. On the single mutants, dnaA and seqA, the plaques are also bigger than those formed on the wild-type host. However, no significant differences in intracellular phage lambda development were observed between wild-type and mutant hosts, indicating that differences in burst size do not account for the observed differences in plaque size. On the other hand, more efficient release of the phage lytic proteins and/or higher sensitivity of the cell membranes to these proteins may result in more efficient cell lysis. We found that the efficiency of adsorption of bacteriophage lambda to the dnaA seqA mutant cells is decreased at 0 degrees C , but not at 30 degrees C, relative to the wild-type strain. A considerable increase in the permeability of membranes of the mutant cells for beta-galactosidase is demonstrated. The dnaA and seqA mutants are more sensitive to ethanol (an organic solvent) than wild-type bacteria, and the seqA strain and the double mutant dnaA seqA are very sensitive to deoxycholate (a detergent). We conclude that lesions in the genes dnaA and seqA result in alterations in cell membranes, such that the permeability and possibly also other properties of the membranes are significantly altered relative to wild-type bacteria.",PubMed
Effect of rev on the cytoplasmic localization of intron-containing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA.,1999,10.1006/viro.1998.9584,10069949,Virology,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proteins are expressed from both intron-containing and completely spliced RNAs. Rev, an HIV-1 regulatory protein, is necessary for the expression of intron-containing RNAs. The effect of Rev on the subcellular localization of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA was examined by in situ RNA hybridization. In the presence of Rev, intron-containing HIV-1 RNA accumulated at the nuclear membrane and within the cytoplasm of transfected cells. In the absence of Rev, intron-containing HIV-1 RNA accumulated within the nucleus. In approximately 20% of the cells transfected in the absence of Rev, intron-containing HIV-1 RNA was also found in the cytoplasm. Differences in the subcytoplasmic localization of intron-containing HIV-1 RNA in the presence and absence of Rev were not observed using in situ RNA hybridization. To determine the effect of Rev on RNA localization within the cytoplasm, an extensive fractionation protocol involving both hypotonic and detergent lysis was used. In the presence of Rev, 40.9 +/- 4.6% of the cytoplasmic intron-containing HIV-1 RNA was released by hypotonic lysis. A similar fractionation profile was seen for several other translated viral and cellular RNAs. However, in the absence of Rev, only 16.5 +/- 5.1% of the cytoplasmic intron-containing HIV-1 RNA was released on hypotonic lysis (P < 0. 005). Thus the cytoplasmic fractionation pattern of this RNA was altered in the absence of Rev.",PubMed
Telomerase is strongly activated in hepatocellular carcinoma but not in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.,1998,10.1038/emm.1998.5,9873820,Experimental & molecular medicine,"Telomerase is highly activated in human immortal cell lines and tumor tissues, whereas it is not activated in primary cell strains and many tumor-adjacent tissues. It is suggested that telomerase activation is one of the critical steps in malignant transformation. In the present study, the telomerase activity was investigated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and non-tumor liver tissues from Korean patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Eighty two liver tissues (24 chronic hepatitis specimens, 34 cirrhosis specimens, and 24 hepatocellular carcinomas) were obtained from 23 chronic viral hepatitis patients, 19 cirrhosis patients (including 7 liver transplants), and 24 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, of which the surrounding non-tumor liver tissues were available in 16 patients (1 chronic hepatitis and 15 cirrhosis). As negative controls, 3 normal liver tissues were included. Protein from liver specimens was purified by a detergent lysis method as described elsewhere, and telomerase activity was measured in 2 diluents of each sample (1:1 and 1:100) by a telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). Telomerase was strongly activated in 79% (19/24) of the hepatocellular carcinomas, while weakly in 8% (2/24) of the chronic hepatitis tissues and in 24% (8/34) of the cirrhosis tissues. All of 3 normal control livers showed no telomerase activation. No relationship could be observed between the enhancement of telomerase activity and tumor nature. None of the chronic heaptitis or cirrhosis patients with mild telomerase activation in the liver have developed hepatocellular carcinoma for at least 2 years of follow-up period. These results suggest that the strong enhancement of telomerase activity may be a critical part of hepatocarcinogenesis, although the exact mechanism of such high activation in hepatocellular carcinoma is not clear. In addition, further study will be necessary to clarify the reason why no telomerase activity detectable by a conventional TRAP can be seen in some hepatocellular carcinoma.",PubMed
Roles of the periplasmic domain of Escherichia coli FtsH (HflB) in protein interactions and activity modulation.,1998,10.1074/jbc.273.35.22326,9712851,The Journal of biological chemistry,"FtsH is a membrane-bound and ATP-dependent protease of Escherichia coli, known to degrade SecY, a membrane protein for protein translocation, and CII, a soluble transcription factor for lysis/lysogeny decision of phage lambda. FtsH forms a homo-oligomeric complex as well as a hetero-oligomeric complex with HflKC, a putative modulator of FtsH. Although FtsH has a small periplasmic region, HflKC is mostly exposed to the periplasmic space. We studied the roles of the periplasmic region of FtsH by engineering mutations in this protein. FtsHDelta236, lacking most of the periplasmic region, retained the in vivo ability to degrade SecY but not CII, resulting in high frequency lysogenization of lambda. Several insertion mutations in the periplasmic region of FtsH also differentially affected the proteolytic activities of FtsH. Interestingly, purified and detergent-solubilized FtsHDelta236 was as active as the wild-type enzyme in degrading SecY and CII, although its ATPase activity was lowered 5-fold. Affinity chromatography using histidine-tagged derivatives showed that the periplasmic domain-deleted FtsH no longer interacted with FtsH or HflKC. Although FtsHDelta236-His6-Myc lost the static FtsH-FtsH interaction, it retained the ability to change its conformation in an ATP-dependent manner at 37 degreesC, leading to a limited oligomerization. These results suggest that the periplasmic region of FtsH has crucial roles in the protein-protein interactions of this complex and in the modulation of its proteolytic functions against different substrates.",PubMed

Integrase is then solubilized from the pellet at high salt conditions (1 M) with detergent and applied to a nickel-charged iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose column. The enzyme is eluted from the column with imidazole. The resulting protein, which is 70-80% homogeneous, is subsequently purified to homogeneity on a heparin-Sepharose column. The two-column protocol is easily completed in a day and yields approximately 2 mg of enzymatically active protein per gram of wet cell paste.",PubMed
Solution structure of a polypeptide from the N terminus of the HIV protein Nef.,1997,10.1021/bi9629945,9166767,Biochemistry,"Nef is a 27 kDa myristylated phosphoprotein expressed early in infection by HIV. The N terminus of Nef is thought to play a vital role in the functions of this protein through its interactions with membrane structures. The solution structure of a 25-residue polypeptide corresponding to the N terminus of Nef (Nef1-25) has been investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In aqueous solution at pH 4.8 and 281 K, this peptide underwent conformational averaging, with Pro13 existing in cis and trans conformations in nearly equal proportions. In methanol solution, however, the peptide adopted a well-defined alpha-helical structure from residues 6 to 22, with the N- and C-terminal regions having a less ordered structure. On the basis of a comparison of chemical shifts and NOEs, it appeared that this helical structure was maintained in aqueous trifluoroethanol (50% v/v) and to a lesser extent in a solution of SDS micelles. When the N-acetyl group was replaced by either an N-myristyl or a free ammonium group, there was little effect on the three-dimensional structure of the peptide in methanol; deamidation of the C terminus also had no effect on the structure in methanol. In water, the myristylated peptide aggregated. The similarity between the sequences of Nef1-25 and melittin is reflected in the similar structures of the two molecules, although the N-terminal helix of melittin is more defined. This similarity in structure raises the possibility that Nef1-25 not only interacts with membranes but also may be capable of disrupting them and causing cell lysis. This type of interaction could contribute at least in part to the killing of bystander cells in lymphoid tissues during HIV infection.",PubMed
Host site selection for concerted integration by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 virions in vitro.,1997,10.1006/viro.1997.8558,9168883,Virology,"Host site selection for full-site integration by human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) intergrase (IN) from nonionic detergent-lysed virions was investigated. Linear retrovirus-like DNA (469 bp) possessing 3' OH recessed long terminal repeat termini was efficiently inserted by a bimolecular donor reaction into a supercoiled DNA target (2867 bp), producing the HIV-1 5-bp host site duplication. Sequence data were analyzed from 193 donor-target recombinants obtained from the linear 3.8-kb DNA product. The selection of host target sites appeared randomly distributed and was independent of lysis and assay conditions. The fidelity of the 5-bp duplications in comparison to other size duplications was highest (94%) with high-salt (300 mM NaCl) lysis of the virions and 60 mM NaCl for strand transfer using Mg2+ as the divalent cation. Base sequence analysis demonstrated some biases in the 5-bp duplications at the sites of strand transfer and at the immediate host sequences surrounding the duplications. In addition to the observed duplications, approximately 30% of the recombinants isolated from the linear 3.8-kb DNA product contained specific and repetitive small-size deletions. No deletions smaller that 17 bp were observed and the distance between the deletion sets had a periodicity of approximately 10 bp. The mechanisms involved in how HIV-1 IN produces the 5-bp duplications and the repetitive host site deletions are discussed.",PubMed
The product of the UL12.5 gene of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a capsid-associated nuclease.,1997,10.1128/JVI.71.4.3039-3047.1997,9060664,Journal of virology,"The UL12 open reading frame of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encodes a deoxyribonuclease that is frequently referred to as alkaline nuclease (AN) because of its high pH optimum. Recently, an alternate open reading frame designated UL12.5 was identified within the UL12 gene. UL12.5 and UL12 have the same translational stop codon, but the former utilizes an internal methionine codon of the latter gene to initiate translation of a 60-kDa amino-terminal truncated form of AN. Since the role of the UL12.5 protein in the HSV-1 life cycle has not yet been determined, its properties were investigated in this study. Unlike AN, which can be readily solubilized from infected cell lysates, the UL12.5 protein was found to be a highly insoluble species, even when isolated by high-salt detergent lysis. Since many of the structural polypeptides which constitute the HSV-1 virion are similarly insoluble, a potential association of UL12.5 protein with virus particles was examined. By using Western blot analysis, the UL12.5 protein could be readily detected in preparations of intact virions, isolated capsid classes, and even capsids that had been extracted with 2 M guanidine-HCl. In contrast, AN was either missing or present at only low levels in each of these structures. Since the inherent insolubility of the UL12.5 protein prevented its potential deoxyribonuclease activity from being assayed in infected-cell lysates, partially purified fractions of soluble UL12.5 protein were generated by selectively solubilizing either insoluble infected-cell proteins or isolated capsid proteins with urea and renaturing them by stepwise dialysis. Initial analysis of these preparations revealed that they did contain an enzymatic activity that was not present in comparable fractions from cells infected with a UL12.5 null mutant of HSV-1. Additional biochemical characterization revealed that UL12.5 protein was similar to AN with respect to pH optimum, ionic strength, and divalent cation requirements and possessed both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic functions. The finding that the UL12.5 protein represents a capsid-associated form of AN which exhibits nucleolytic activity suggests that it may play some role in the processing of genomic DNA during encapsidation.",PubMed

The phage-cured strain N. magadii(L13) was used to demonstrate infectivity of phage phi Ch1. The turbid-plaque morphology and the fact that N. magadii cells isolated from plaques were able to produce phage indicated that phi Ch1 is a temperate phage. The phage morphology resembles other members of Myoviridae-infecting Halobacterium species. In solution below 2M NaCl, the phage lost its morphological stability and infectivity. One- and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE of phage particles revealed at least four major and five minor proteins with molecular masses ranging from 15 to 80 kDa and acidic isoelectric points. Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA of a lysogenic N. magadii strain showed that phi Ch1 exists as a chromosomally integrated prophage. The phage particles contain both double-stranded, linear DNA (approx. 55 kbp) as well as several RNA species (80-700 nucleotides). Hybridization of labelled RNA fragments to total DNA from N. magadii and phi Ch1 showed that the virion-associated RNA is host encoded.

P., Peterson, D. L. & Gavilanes, F. (1995) J. Gen. Virol. 76, 301-308]. The conformation of this putative fusion peptide has been studied, both at low and high peptide concentrations, by means of circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. When the peptide is dissolved in trifluoroethanol, a significant population of alpha-helical structure is found in spite of the proline residue at position 11. In contrast, this hydrophobic oligopeptide has a high tendency to form large beta-sheet aggregates in aqueous buffers. Most of these aggregates can be eliminated by centrifugation. The peptide remaining in the supernatant adopts a non-ordered conformation. The aggregates can be dissociated by the anionic detergent sodium cholate, but the peptide still maintains an extended conformation. In the presence of acidic phospholipid vesicles, the putative fusion peptide adopts a highly stable beta-sheet conformation. Thus, unlike the fusion peptides of other viruses, an extended conformation seems to be the preferred structure when interacting with phospholipids. Such a conformation should be responsible for its membrane destabilization properties.",PubMed
Processing of long-stored archival cervical smears for human papillomavirus detection by the polymerase chain reaction.,1995,10.1038/bjc.1995.347,7543772,British journal of cancer,"The efficiency of a freeze-thaw method, a proteinase K/Tween 20 lysis method and a guanidinium isothiocyanate/silica beads method for DNA extraction from fixed and Papanicolaou-stained cells from the cervical cancer cell line Siha was measured by beta-globin polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The GTC/silica beads method, which appeared superior, revealed a human papillomavirus (HPV) general primer-mediated PCR sensitivity of 50-500 copies of HPV 16 per sample using dilutions of fixed and stained Siha cells. Application to archival cervical smears (n = 116) revealed that the yield and size of amplifiable DNA decreases with storage time. The longer the storage time, the more repetitions of the whole procedure, including the lysis step, were required to extract sufficient amplifiable DNA. In this way, an overall beta-globin PCR positivity for 98% of the smears was reached. Further analysis revealed that a maximum size of 200 bp could be amplified from smears stored for up to 9 years. The method was validated by demonstrating by PCR the same HPV types in archival smears and corresponding cervical biopsies of cervical cancer patients. In conclusion, the GTC/silica beads method appears suitable to process archival cervical smears for HPV detection by PCR. provided that stepwise adjustments are made until beta-globin PCR positivity is obtained and primers are chosen which amplify a maximum of about 200 bp.",PubMed
Characterization of the virions of mopyridone-sensitive wild strain and mopyridone-resistant mutant of influenza virus A(H3N2).,1995,,7676940,Acta virologica,"Some differences were established between mopyridone-sensitive (MCU-s) wild strain and mopyridone-resistant (MCU-r) mutant progenies of influenza virus A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2). The virions of MCU-r mutant had a lower buoyant density in linear sucrose gradient as compared to those of MCU-s strain, and an increased ability of aggregation as well. HA content (HAU/micrograms protein) in the purified virions of MCU-r mutant was twice lower as compared to MCU-s strain. The surface glycoproteins of MCU-r mutant were solubilized by octylglucoside faster than those of MCU-s strain. No differences were found between MCU-r strain and MCU-s mutant-induced red blood cell lysis at acid pH, and mopyridone did not influence this phenomenon. MCU-r mutant showed a lower thermostability as compared with MCU-s strain, but similar UV-inactivation curves for both viruses were observed. The quantity of the purified HA-NA complex and M1 protein incorporated into multilamellar liposomes was greater in the case of MCU-s mutant. Electron microscopy examination of liposomes which contained M1 protein from MCU-r mutant manifested pleomorphism with unusual gigantic forms tending to aggregate, whereas MCU-s M1 protein-containing liposomes were uniform and did not form aggregates. No morphological differences were found between the two viruses in HA-NA complex containing liposomes. These data indicate changes in the protein-lipid interactions in MCU-r mutant virions. Amino acid analysis of M1 protein revealed significantly lower content of asparagine, glutamine and serine, and a higher one oof hisitidine in MCU-r mutant as compared to MCU-s wild strain.",PubMed
Mechanism of adenovirus-mediated endosome lysis: role of the intact adenovirus capsid structure.,1994,10.1006/bbrc.1994.2809,7802664,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,"Adenoviruses have been previously shown to enhance the delivery of many ligands including proteins and plasmid DNAs to the cells. The key biochemical step during this process is the ability of adenovirus to disrupt (lyse) the endosome membrane releasing the co-internalized virus and the other ligands into the cytosol (Seth et al, 1986, In: Adenovirus attachment and entry into cells, pp 191-195, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.). To understand the role of the adenovirus proteins involved in the endosome lysis, it is further shown here that empty capsids of adenovirus also possess this membrane vesicle lytic activity; though the activity is about 5-times lower than the adenovirus. Incubation of adenovirus with low concentration of ionic detergent or brief exposure to 45 degrees C destroyed this lytic activity without affecting the adenovirus binding to cell surface receptor, suggesting the lytic activity of adenovirus to be of enzymatic nature. However, exposing adenovirus to conditions that can disrupt adenovirus capsid structure such as heating at 65 degrees C, treating with 0.5% SDS, treating with different proteases, dialyzing against no glycerol buffer, treating with 6 M urea or with 10% pyridine, and sonication destroyed the adenovirus-associated lytic activity. Results suggest the requirement of an intact capsid structure for adenovirus-mediated lysis of the endosome.",PubMed
A light-responsive in vitro transcription system from evacuolated parsley protoplasts.,1994,10.1111/j.1365-313x.1994.00437.x,8180626,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,"Evacuolated protoplasts (EP) retain transcriptional activity responding, after UV-light treatment, to the expression of chalcone synthase (CHS); this behaviour is similar to the parsley cell culture and protoplasts from which the EP were derived. Chemical lysis of the EP with low concentrations of a detergent in a minimal volume had no negative effect on the inducibility of CHS by UV-containing white light. Based on these observations a new method is presented here for establishing a light-responsive in vitro transcription system from evacuolated protoplasts of a parsley (Petroselinum crispum) cell culture. A 615 bp promoter fragment of the CHS gene, fused to the beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, was accurately transcribed as in transiently transformed protoplasts and the reaction was highly sensitive to alpha-amanitin. A 226 bp CHS promoter/GUS reporter construct with mutated cis-acting elements was unable to stimulate GUS transcription, whilst a 341 bp 35S-promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) was constitutively expressed in dark- or light-treated lysates. The expression of the CHS full-length promoter/GUS construct in the cell-free system was three-fold increased by white or red light compared with the dark level. These results demonstrate that within this in vitro system there must exist a largely intact signal transduction chain between photoreceptor(s) and the CHS promoter. As such it will be a valuable tool for elucidating signalling mechanisms and functional assays of trans-acting factors acting at the end of the pathway.",PubMed

"The expression of hemolytically active human complement protein C9 in mammalian, insect, and yeast cells.",1993,10.1006/prep.1993.1020,8471847,Protein expression and purification,"The cDNA sequence encoding mature human C9 protein and its signal peptide was cloned into three expression vectors for expression in COS-7 (mammalian), Spodoptera frugiperda IPLB-SF-21AE (insect), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) cells. In addition, C9 cDNA encoding only the mature protein was fused to the yeast invertase leader sequence (SUC2) and cloned for expression in yeast. Under optimal conditions COS-7 and IPLB-SF-21AE cells secreted recombinant C9 (rC9) at concentrations of about 111 and 700 ng C9/ml culture supernatant, respectively. By comparison S. cerevisiae, whether transformed with C9 cDNA containing its native or yeast invertase leader sequence, secreted only very small amounts of rC9 (5-10 ng/ml). However, upon lysis concentrations of up to 500 ng/mg dry wt were found in yeast cells transformed with C9 cDNA. SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis revealed COS-7 cell and S. cerevisiae expressed rC9 to have a MW similar to that of native C9 purified from human serum, while rC9 from IPLB-SF-21AE cells was about 4 kDa smaller. No hemolytic activity of S. cerevisiae secreted rC9 could be detected and the specific hemolytic activity of S. cerevisiae intracellular rC9 was also very low. However, the specific hemolytic activities of COS-7 and IPLB-SF-21AE secreted rC9 were indistinguishable from that of purified native human C9. Thus, for future studies on the structure and function of C9 where the production of large quantities of mutant protein would be desirable, the baculovirus-insect cell expression system appears to offer considerable advantages.",PubMed
"NF-ATp, a T lymphocyte DNA-binding protein that is a target for calcineurin and immunosuppressive drugs.",1993,,7679116,The Journal of biological chemistry,"The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) is essential for transcription of the interleukin-2 gene upon T cell activation. Here we use a technique involving elution and renaturation of proteins from SDS-acrylamide gels to identify a DNA-binding component of NF-AT (NF-ATp) that is present in hypotonic extracts of T cells prior to activation and appears in nuclear extracts when T cells are activated. NF-ATp is present in resting T cells predominantly in a form migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 110,000-140,000, while NF-ATp from nuclear extracts of activated T cells migrates with a lower apparent molecular weight (90,000-125,000). This difference is likely to reflect dephosphorylation of NF-ATp, since treatment of NF-ATp with calf intestinal phosphatase or the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in vitro results in a similar decrease in its apparent molecular weight. We show that NF-ATp is dephosphorylated in cell lysates by a calcium-dependent process that is blocked by inclusion of EGTA or a specific peptide inhibitor of calcineurin in the cell lysis buffer. Moreover, dephosphorylation of NF-ATp in cell extracts is inhibited by prior treatment of T cells with the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A or FK506, which inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin when complexed with their specific binding proteins, cyclophilin and FK506-binding protein. This work identifies NF-ATp as a DNA-binding phosphoprotein and a target for the drug/immunophilin/calcineurin complexes thought to mediate the inhibition of interleukin-2 gene induction by cyclosporin A and FK506.",PubMed
Selective release of recombinant protein particles (VLPs) from yeast using a pure lytic glucanase enzyme.,1993,10.1038/nbt0293-214,7764040,Bio/technology (Nature Publishing Company),"We have used a pure lytic glucanase enzyme to selectively release recombinant 60 nm protein particles (virus like particles or VLPs) from yeast cells. Although the protease components of the lytic enzyme complexes were found to degrade the VLPs, purified glucanase enzymes from these complexes (derived from Cytophaga sp. and Oerskovia sp.) produced cell lysis without degradation and released the VLPs in the absence of mercaptoethanol, a reducing agent commonly used in cell lysis. The Oerskovia glucanase enzyme released the recombinant protein particles selectively as it only produced ca. 17% cell lysis compared to the use of the total lytic enzyme preparation. The use of osmotic supports did not improve the recovery of VLPs, however, treatment of the enzymatically lysed pellet with Triton X-100 did increase the amount of VLPs released. This 'selectivity', which results in the release of the recombinant particles with only a fraction of contaminating proteins, represents an improvement over presently used mechanical or enzymatic cell disruption processes.",PubMed
The asiA gene of bacteriophage T4 codes for the anti-sigma 70 protein.,1993,10.1128/jb.175.1.85-93.1993,8416914,Journal of bacteriology,"The anti-sigma 70 factor of bacteriophage T4 is a 10-kDa (10K) protein which inhibits the sigma 70-directed initiation of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme. We have partially purified the anti-sigma 70 factor and obtained the sequence of a C-terminal peptide of this protein. Using reverse genetics, we have identified, at the end of the lysis gene t and downstream of an as yet unassigned phage T4 early promoter, an open reading frame encoding a 90-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 10,590. This protein has been overproduced in a phage T7 expression system and partially purified. It shows a strong inhibitory activity towards sigma 70-directed transcription (by RNA polymerase holoenzyme), whereas it has no significant effect on sigma 70-independent transcription (by RNA polymerase core enzyme). At high ionic strength, this inhibition is fully antagonized by the neutral detergent Triton X-100. Our results corroborate the initial observations on the properties of the phage T4 10K anti-sigma 70 factor, and we therefore propose that the gene which we call asiA, identified in the present study, corresponds to the gene encoding this T4 transcriptional inhibitor.",PubMed
c-MYC mRNA is present in human sperm cells.,1993,,8220581,Cellular & molecular biology research,"Stage-specific expression of proto-oncogenes, including c-myc, has been demonstrated during spermatogenesis in testis. Some of these proto-oncogenes are expressed postmeiotically, especially in the round spermatid stage. Recently, we demonstrated the presence of c-myc protein in mature ejaculated sperm cells with a possible role in sperm cell function. Since the half-life of c-myc protein has been shown to be short, we suspected the presence of c-myc mRNA in human sperm cells. In the present study, the presence of the c-myc mRNA transcript in human sperm cells was investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and in situ hybridization. Total RNA, 5-10 micrograms, was extracted from 0.2-0.5 ml of pelleted human sperm cells by NP-40 lysis procedure, and was used to construct cDNA with pd(N)6 random primer and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase. The PCR with sperm cDNA and primers #P1 and #P2, both from exon 3, resulted in amplification of the expected 322 bp product. Primers #P3 and #P4, which are located in exon 2 and exon 3, respectively, and are 1.37 kb apart, gave the expected PCR amplified 313 bp product ruling out the possibility of DNA contamination. The presence of c-myc mRNA in human sperm cells was further confirmed by in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin labelled DNA probe, containing exon 2 of the c-myc gene sequence. The c-myc specific DNA probe reacted with the postacrosomal mid-piece and tail regions of both noncapacitated as well as capacitated methanol-fixed sperm cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",PubMed

By this method, blood samples are processed in two simple 15-min steps: (1) separation of PBLs from whole blood by red blood cell lysis with the Roche Specimen Washing Solution, and (2) DNA extraction by heat-detergent treatment of separated PBLs. This new method is simpler than the standard Ficoll-Hypaque method for PBLs separation and Proteinase K digestion for DNA extraction. It is not inhibitory to DNA amplification and it allows effective processing of blood samples even after prolonged storage (as long as 8 days) at room temperature.",PubMed

Molecular and ultrastructural analysis of heavy membrane fractions associated with the replication of Kunjin virus RNA.,1992,10.1007/BF01309636,1322651,Archives of virology,"In subcellular extracts of Kunjin virus-infected cells prepared by lysis and differential centrifugation, the viral RNA polymerase, RNA and proteins were associated mainly with cytoplasm. When the cytoplasmic extract (500 g supernate) of infected cells labelled for 3 h from 24 h post-infection was further fractionated by rapid centrifugation through a sucrose density gradient, all viral products were located only in dense or ""heavy membrane"" fractions, which contained three types of virus-induced morphologically distinct membrane structures. These dense fractions were treated with 0.5% NP40 and the soluble material was again centrifuged through a sucrose gradient for analyses as before. Viral RNA polymerase activity was retained and was associated with replicative intermediate RNA and some replicative form RNA in the peak enzyme fractions sedimenting at 20S to 40S. Enrichment of NS3 and of the small nonstructural proteins NS2A and NS2B/NS4A was apparent in these fractions which were well separated from the slow sedimenting structural proteins. No detergent-resistant structures in the ""heavy membrane"" fractions other than ribosome-like particles were visible. The data show that the RNA polymerase complex cosedimented with virus-induced membrane structures and remained associated with specific nonstructural proteins and replicative intermediate RNA after detergent treatment.",PubMed
Partial purification and characterization of the reverse transcriptase of the simian immunodeficiency virus TYO-7 isolated from an African green monkey.,1990,10.1021/bi00459a015,1691922,Biochemistry,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) was partially purified by a newly developed procedure from the simian immunodeficiency virus TYO-7 isolated from an African green monkey (SIVagmTYO-7). The method comprised lysis of the virus with nonionic detergent followed by two centrifugations in isopycnic sucrose density gradients and one velocity sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. The enzyme exhibited a purity of 70-80% and showed an exceptional high specific activity of 135 nmol incorporation of dTMP per milligram of protein in 1 h with poly(rA).oligo(dT) as template-primer (TP). The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated by velocity sedimentation analysis as 120K-130K. Investigation of the RT by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that the active enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a 64- and a 50-kDa subunit. The two subunits were identified to be RT specific by Western blot analysis. In activity gels, both subunits exhibited enzymatic activity, whereby the 64-kDa subunit showed the predominant activity. The RT preferred the TP poly(rA).oligo(dT) over poly(rC).oligo(dG). With poly(rCm).oligo(dG), only marginal activity was detected, and no activity was measured with poly(dA).oligo(dT). The TP specificity was influenced by the reaction temperature. The highest activity was measured around the melting temperature of the TP used. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was more thermolabile when measured with poly(rA).oligo(dT) than with poly(rC).oligo(dG). To compare the specificity of RT inhibitors, their inhibition efficiency (IE) was defined as the ratio of the 50% inhibiting concentration (ID50) obtained with the RT in viral lysates to the ID50 of purified RT.",PubMed
Analysis of pp60c-src tyrosine kinase activity and phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity in human colon carcinoma and normal human colon mucosal cells.,1987,10.1002/jcb.240350205,2448318,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"We have compared the level of phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity in lysates from normal human colon mucosal cells and human colon carcinoma cells and analyzed the effect of incubating these cells with sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity, on the relative abundance of acid-stable phosphotyrosine and on in vitro protein kinase activity of pp60c-src. Additionally, we compared the effect of lysing these cells in buffer containing only nonionic detergents with RIPA buffer, which contains both sodium dodecyl sulfate and deoxycholate, on the in vitro kinase activity of pp60c-src. Our results show that the level of detectable phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity in lysates derived from normal colon cells and colon carcinoma cells is very similar. Additionally, the abundance of acid-stable phosphotyrosine in these cells cultured in the absence or presence of vanadate is not significantly different. However, incubation of these cells with vanadate significantly stimulates the activity of pp60c-src derived from the normal colon cells in immune-complex kinase assays, while having no detectable effect on the activity of pp60c-src from the colon tumor cells. The in vitro protein kinase activity of pp60c-src derived from RIPA buffer lysates of colon carcinoma cells was found to be elevated five- to sevenfold when compared with pp60c-src from these same cells lysed in buffer containing only Nonidet-P 40 as a detergent. The type of lysis buffer did not effect the activity of pp60c-src from normal colon mucosal cells. These results provide additional evidence that the activity of pp60c-src may be regulated differently in colon carcinoma and normal colon mucosal cells.",PubMed
Expression of cDNAs for G proteins in Escherichia coli. Two forms of Gs alpha stimulate adenylate cyclase.,1987,,3112160,The Journal of biological chemistry,"Complementary DNAs that encode two forms of the alpha subunit (Gs alpha) of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein responsible for stimulation of adenylate cyclase (Gs) have been inserted into plasmid vectors for expression in Escherichia coli. Following transformation of either of these plasmids into E. coli K38, Gs alpha accumulates to 0.4-0.8 mg/liter (approximately 0.1% of total protein), as judged by immunoblot analysis with specific antisera. Based on deduced amino acid sequence, the two cDNAs should encode proteins with molecular weights of 44,500 and 46,000, respectively (Robishaw, J.D., Smigel, M. D., and Gilman, A. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9587-9590). Expression of these cDNAs in E. coli yields proteins that co-migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the Gs alpha subunits from S49 lymphoma cell membranes, with apparent molecular weights of 45,000 and 52,000, respectively. Low levels of activity are detected in the 100,000 X g supernatant after lysis and fractionation of E. coli expressing either form of Gs alpha. Partial purification of Gs alpha from E. coli lysates yields preparations in which significant and stable activity can be assayed. Both forms of Gs alpha migrate through sucrose gradients as soluble, monodisperse species in the absence of detergent. As expressed in E. coli, both forms of Gs alpha can reconstitute isoproterenol-, guanine nucleotide-, and fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in S49 cyc-cell membranes to approximately the same degree and can be ADP-ribosylated with [32P]NAD+ and cholera toxin. However, based on the specific activity of purified rabbit liver Gs, only 1-2% of the Gs alpha expressed in E. coli appears to be active. Incubation of partially purified fractions of recombinant Gs alpha with guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate and resolved beta gamma subunits isolated from purified bovine brain G proteins results in a 7-10-fold increase in Gs activity. Incubation of bovine brain beta gamma with recombinant Gs alpha also leads to a dramatic increase in observed levels of cholera toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation.",PubMed

Lysis of the CSF leukocytes with Triton X-100 resulted in a substantial increase of phosphohexose isomerase activity. In bacterial meningitis these values increased to 200 to 7000 U/l, but remained under 150 U/l in viral meningitis.

Preparation and characterization of F-protein vesicles isolated from Sendai virus by means of octyl glucoside.,1986,10.1016/0005-2736(86)90093-3,3008840,Biochimica et biophysica acta,"We have demonstrated that Triton X-100 is always present in F-protein vesicles at concentrations that can provoke cell lysis. In order to avoid any misinterpretation of the fusogenic capacity of this protein, we solubilized the Sendai virus using octyl glucoside, which can be totally removed from the F protein preparation in less than 16 h by dialysis in the presence of absorbent beads. F-glycoprotein preparations preserved their ability to lyse erythrocytes in the presence of lectins and to induce cell-vesicle fusion as demonstrated by ESR studies. These vesicles were characterized by electron microscopy and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lipid analysis of these preparations by thin-layer chromatography indicated that they had the same proportion of lipids as virus envelopes, with slight variations in the sphingomyelin content and the cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio. F-protein vesicles of different sizes can be obtained by adding exogenous lipids before detergent removal. The hemolytic activity of the vesicles was retained over a large range of lipid concentrations. We conclude that F-protein vesicles prepared with octyl glucoside are convenient tools for studying the fusogenic mechanism of this protein and improving the fusion process between liposomes and cells.",PubMed
pH-dependent lysis of liposomes by adenovirus.,1986,10.1021/bi00356a057,3754765,Biochemistry,"Purified adenovirus induced a dose-dependent release of the water-soluble markers calcein and carboxyfluorescein from liposomes. Marker release was strongly dependent on pH, and at temperatures below 5 degrees C, the rate of release showed an optimum at a pH of about 6. This pH dependence parallels disruption of endocytic vesicles by adenovirus and the permeabilization that adenovirus induces on the cell surface. There did not seem to be a striking dependence on the lipid composition of the liposomes. Electron microscopy using a negative stain shows liposomes bound to adenovirus. In some cases, the liposomes were still intact, but many liposomes, which were attached to the vertices of the virus, appeared lysed. These data support the notion that adenovirus, which enters the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, gains access to the cytoplasm by a subsequent pH-dependent disruption of the membrane of the endocytic vesicle.",PubMed
Phage adsorption and productive lysis in stable protoplast type L-forms of Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces hygroscopicus.,1986,10.1002/jobm.3620260106,3083088,Journal of basic microbiology,"Transferable productive lysis in stable protoplast type L-form cells of Bacillus subtilis was produced by 6 phages out of 14 strains virulent for the parent B. subtilis 170 and 1997.

Electron microscopic investigation and treatment by DNAse demonstrated that infection of L-form cells is an adsorption-injection process, and that it is not caused by transfection of free phage DNA or endocytotic uptake of phage particles. Because in both stable L-forms cell wall biosynthesis is blocked irreversibly the results allow the conclusion that specific receptors must be localized in the cytoplasmic membrane for those phages producing transferable lysis in protoplast type L-forms. Localization of receptors for certain phages in the cytoplasmic membrane seems to occur in many Gram-positive bacteria, but not in Gram-negative bacteria.",PubMed
Detection of c-abl tyrosine kinase activity in vitro permits direct comparison of normal and altered abl gene products.,1985,10.1128/mcb.5.11.3116-3123.1985,3879812,Molecular and cellular biology,"The v-abl transforming protein P160v-abl and the P210c-abl gene product of the translocated c-abl gene in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells have tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity.

Reaction conditions were modified to identify conditions which would permit the detection of c-abl tyrosine kinase activity. It was found that the Formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus formerly used for immunoprecipitation inhibits in vitro abl kinase activity. In addition, the sodium dodecyl sulfate and deoxycholate detergents formerly used in the cell lysis buffer were found to decrease recovered abl kinase activity. The discovery of assay conditions for c-abl kinase activity now makes it possible to compare P150c-abl and P145c-abl kinase activity with the altered abl proteins P160v-abl and P210c-abl. Although all of the abl proteins have in vitro tyrosine kinase activity, they differ in the way they utilize themselves as substrates in vitro.

The tail-lysozyme has N-acetylmuramidase activity and the same substrate specificity as gene e lysozyme; the optimum pH is around 5.8, about 1 pH unit lower than for the e lysozyme. We assume that the tail-lysozyme plays an essential role in locally digesting the peptidoglycan layer to let the tube penetrate into the periplasmic space. The tail-lysozyme is presumably also responsible for ""lysis from without.""",PubMed

After removal of the detergent typical micellar aggregates were shown to form from GP monomers for all three viruses under study. The forming rosettes morphologically and biologically are similar to those isolated from ortho-, paramyxo-, and togaviruses using the Triton X-100 detergent. Stages of liposome formation and interaction with cell membrane were studied electron microscopically. A common feature for liposomes from GP of all the three viruses consisted in the formation of two morphological variants of structural complexes: filaments of various lengths and composition in them of GP and vesicles, the arrays of GP in which were similar or identical to those of viral membrane. Liposomes from Sendai virus GP possessed hemolytic activity, however, their interaction with the cell studied by means of the immunoferritine label occurred not by fusion but apparently as a result of destruction of the cell membrane at the sites of protein F contact with plasmalemma and formation in the latter of defects leading to erythrocyte lysis.",PubMed

Especially anionic detergents proved to be able to influence the plaque formation substantially. In high concentrations of Metaupon, Fekunil 602, Fekunil S-BA, Emulgator W 270, and Emulgator O-BA the plaque formation by the phages M 12 and f2 was inhibited and in low concentrations it was promoted. In the system Q beta/E. coli AB 301 the effect of the detergents mentioned was restricted to the prevention of the appearance of plaques. The detergent E 30 brought about only plaque inhibitions, too, in all used RNA-phages/E. coli systems. The treatment with effective detergents in the system PP7/P. aeruginosa, however, increased only the number of plaques. This phenomenon was evident in the formation of radiate plaque patterns in the lawn of bacteria. In the case of RNA-phages of E. coli the formation of such trains of lysis depends on the choice of the nutritive medium. The addition of the detergent Fekunil 602 at different times after the contact between phages and host bacteria affects the length of the beams of lysis. The ionogenity of surfactants seems to be of importance for the formation of radiate plaque patterns, since the tested cationic compound and the nonionic surfactants, contrary to anionic surfactants, did not cause any beams of lysis.",PubMed
Lysis protein encoded by plasmid ColA-CA31. Gene sequence and export.,1985,10.1007/BF00327516,3889552,Molecular & general genetics : MGG,"A gene, cal, coding for a polypeptide needed for the release of colicin A from Escherichia coli cells has been identified by transposon insertion. The cal gene was located on the ColA plasmid map adjacent to cai, the gene coding for colicin A immunity protein, and therefore 592 bases downstream from caa, the structural gene for colicin A. Transcription of cal is in the same direction as caa, that is in the opposite direction to cai. Its sequence has been determined and the predicted amino acid composition features a basic N-terminal end followed by a serie of hydrophobic residues similar to the signal sequence in precursors of exported proteins. The C-terminal part also contains a core of hydrophobic residues. The overall amino acid sequence of the cal protein is homologous to that of lytic proteins encoded by the related plasmids pColE1, and pCloDF13. The cal protein has been identified on urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gels by selective labelling with various radioactive amino acids and its synthesis is co-induced with that of colicin A. The cal protein undergoes slow processing with loss of the N-terminal ""signal"" region and the mature form is released into the medium together with colicin A.",PubMed
Regulation of the microfilament system in normal and polyoma virus transformed cultured (BHK) cells.,1985,10.1016/0040-8166(85)90084-9,2990068,Tissue & cell,"The content and state of actin in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells before and after transformation with polyoma virus were examined by deoxyribonuclease assay and gel electrophoresis followed by dye elution. The actin content of the transformed cells, relative to total cell protein, was lower than that of the normal cells by 30-50%. In both the normal and transformed cells the greater part of the total actin was found on lysis to be in the monomeric state. Cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of the two cell lines were, in qualitative terms, very similar in their protein compositions. The plasma membrane isolated from the transformed cells was richer in actin than that from the untransformed, and both membrane fractions contained proteins corresponding to myosin, filamin and alpha-actinin on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The cell extract from both the normal and transformed lines formed an actin-based gel on incubation at 30 degrees C, although the amount of the cross-linked actin was much smaller in the latter. This was a consequence not only of the lower concentration of total actin in the cell, but also, presumably, of a gross relative deficiency in the concentration or activity of filament cross-linking protein(s) in the cytoplasm. Thus, small aliquots of cytoplasmic fractions from transformed cells, when added to an excess of exogenous F-actin, were able to cross-link the filaments to a much smaller extent than those from the normal cells. A similar range of proteins was found to be associated with the actin gels formed from both cell extracts. One conspicuous difference was that a species migrating in SDS-gel electrophoresis as a doublet with a subunit molecular weight of about 58,000, and tentatively identified as intermediate filament protein, was replaced in the transformed cells by a single band. Filament cross-linking activity of the cytoplasmic fractions was enhanced by addition of Triton extracts of crude membranes, although the latter were not capable of cross-linking exogenous F-actin on their own. The effect of Triton extracts was much greater in the case of membranes from the transformed cells. The cytoplasmic fractions of BHK cells contain capping protein(s) and/or complexes of such proteins with actin; these reveal themselves by the propensity of the extracts to nucleate polymerization of exogenous G-actin. This activity was more abundant in transformed cells, despite their lower actin content. Their membranes were also more effective in nucleating G-actin polymerization, indicating the presence of a greater number of filament ends.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",PubMed
Kinetics and characterization of the proteins synthesized during infection by bacteriophage PM2.,1982,10.1099/0022-1317-60-1-135,7097247,The Journal of general virology,"Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we have examined the proteins whose synthesis is stimulated in Alteromonas espejiana by infection with the membrane-containing bacteriophage PM2. In addition to four virus structural proteins, 11 non-structural proteins have been resolved and identified by their apparent isoelectric points and molecular weights. The relative rate of synthesis of each of the proteins was determined during the course of infection. Synthesis of the earliest proteins began around 10 min after infection. Synthesis of the virus structural proteins as a group did not begin until about 25 min after infection. In contrast to these structural proteins, the rate of synthesis of most of the non-structural virus proteins began to decline between 30 and 35 min after infection. This time preceded the onset of cell lysis marked by ion leakage (47 min); it corresponded to the beginning of packaging of virus DNA, removing that DNA from replication and transcription. Protein processing could not be demonstrated by pulse-chase labelling. These 15 proteins account for all of the coding capacity of the virus DNA. The virus origin of 14 of these proteins was established in an in vitro transcription-translation system programmed by PM2 DNA.",PubMed
Mode of action of colicin S8.,1982,10.1099/00221287-128-5-973,7050299,Journal of general microbiology,"The mode of action of colicin S8 has been studied and compared with that of other colicins. Two minutes after the addition of colicin S8 to bacteria a considerable proportion of the colicin is inaccessible to trypsin. Treatment of bacteria with colicin S8 renders them more sensitive to lysis by sodium dodecyl sulphate and also inhibits motility. Like colicins K and E1, colicin S8 provokes lysis of bacteria superinfected with bacteriophage T4. Colicin S8, unlike colicin E2, prevents replication of bacteriophage T4. The incorporation of isoleucine or uracil into bacteria is inhibited by colicin S8 but, unlike colicins K and E1, the effect is multiplicity-dependent. A rapid method of titration of colicin S8 is described. The results are discussed with emphasis on the possible rearrangements at the bacterial surface and the possibility that there is more than one type of specific receptor for colicin S8.",PubMed
New way to isolate simian virus 40 nucleoprotein complexes from infected cells: use of a thiol-specific reagent.,1982,10.1128/JVI.42.1.292-296.1982,6283146,Journal of virology,"A new method for the isolation of simian virus 40 nucleoprotein complexes from nuclei of lytically infected cells is described. The method is based on the addition of a thiol-specific reagent, 5'5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), to lysis and extraction buffers. By inhibiting an uncoating activity during simian virus 40 extraction, 5'5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) allows the use of efficient extraction buffers, such as one containing Triton X-100 and EDTA, for the isolation of native simian virus 40 minichromosomes and virion-type structures. Use of the method is illustrated by following encapsidation of simian virus 40 minichromosomes in a pulse-chase experiment. Since 5'5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) is an inhibitor of many different enzymes, the 5',5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) extraction technique may be useful for the isolation of not only papovaviruses but also other viruses and possibly cellular chromatin.",PubMed

Effect of defective phages on the cell membrane of Bacillus subtilis and partial characterization of the phage protein involved in killing.,1981,10.1099/0022-1317-56-2-275,6796649,The Journal of general virology,"In order to investigate whether defective phages of Bacillus subtilis killed sensitive bacteria by a lysis from without mechanism, the minimal number of phages required for killing was determined. This figure was found to vary with the m.o.i., giving a value of 1 on extrapolation to an m.o.i. of 0. This excluded lysis from without as the only killing mechanism, although it might play a role at high m.o.i.s. This was confirmed by experiments on leakage of ATP and u.v.-absorbing material, the uptake of oxygen and the effect of the phages on the membrane potential. Apart from a short, initial leakage of ATP, the cell membrane was not affected at low m.o.i.s. These results lead to the conclusion that at low m.o.i.s. the phages acted on a cytoplasmic component. Treatment of defective phages for 10 min at pH 2.5 resulted in breakdown of the phages without complete abolition of the killing activity. The active component, which was shown not to be DNA, could not be isolated from the mixture, but SDS gel electrophoresis of PBS X and a non-killing mutant of this phage suggested that a protein with a mol. wt. of 85000 was involved in killing.",PubMed
Asymmetric and symmetric membrane reconstitution by detergent elimination. Studies with Semliki-Forest-virus spike glycoprotein and penicillinase from the membrane of Bacillus licheniformis.,1981,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1981.tb05296.x,6972870,European journal of biochemistry,"The dissociation and reconstitution of the Semliki Forest virus membrane using the nonionic detergent octyl beta-D-glucoside was studied by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The dissociation occurred in three stages: lysis at a free equilibrium octyl glucoside concentration of 14--18 mM, solubilization at 18--20 mM, and delipidation of the spike glycoproteins at the critical micellar concentration (22 mM) or higher. After solubilization the spike glycoproteins were present as soluble complexes with sedimentation coefficients of 19 S and 6 S. The 6-S form probably corresponded to a glycoprotein monomer complexed to detergent and the 19-S form consisted of oligomeric detergent-protein complexes. The two forms were in slow equilibrium with each other. When the soluble spike protein complexes and egg lecithin solubilized with octyl glucoside were mixed and the octyl glucoside concentration lowered either by dialysis or by dilution, reconstitution occurred. Three types of products were obtained: vesicles with 30% of the spike protein facing inwards and 70% facing outwards, vesicles with virtually all (95%) of the spike proteins pointing outwards, and small protein-rich soluble aggregates [Helenius et al. (1977) J. Cell Biol. 75, 866]. It was demonstrated that during reconstitution the symmetric vesicles were formed at 19 mM free equilibrium octyl glucoside by the association of the 6-S protein complexes with the phospholipids, and the asymmetric vesicles were formed at 10--16 mM octyl glucoside when the 19-S complexes associated with the lipids. Asymmetric membrane vesicles were also obtained when membrane penicillinase from Bacillus licheniformis was reconstituted with egg lecithin using octyl glucoside. It could be shown that the penicillinase was oligomeric at the octyl glycoside concentration where the reconstitution occurred. The results demonstrate that different mechanisms of reconstitution give rise to the symmetric and the asymmetric vesicles. The critical factor in determining the mechanism is the state of aggregation of the proteins at the octyl glucoside concentration where membranes begin to form from the solubilized lipids.",PubMed
Activation of the Sendai virus fusion protein (f) involves a conformational change with exposure of a new hydrophobic region.,1981,,6259173,The Journal of biological chemistry,"The F protein of paramyxoviruses is actively involved in the induction of membrane fusion. This fusion may be between viral and cellular membranes, as in the initiation of infection or in virus-induced lysis of erythrocytes, or between the plasma membranes of different cells. The F protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage to yield two disulfide-linked polypeptides (F1 and F2); however, its mechanism of action is not clear. In the present study, the conformations of the inactive, uncleaved precursor of glycoprotein (F0), and the active, cleaved form (F1,2) have been compared. The UV circular dichroism spectra of the two forms of the F protein indicate that cleavage results in a conformational change. Detergent-binding studies by velocity sedimentation analysis of Triton X-100-protein complexes revealed an increase in exposed hydrophobic surface of the protein on cleavage. The inactive F0 bound an estimated 27 molecules of Triton X-100/F polypeptide; these molecules are presumably bound to the hydrophobic region of the glycoprotein that anchors the spike-like protein in the virus membrane and that is common to both forms of F. The active form, F1,2, bound 67 molecules of Triton X-100. This increase in the number of detergent binding sites upon F protein activation indicates the presence of a hydrophobic region that is peculiar to the active form, and that may be of functional significance in the membrane fusion reaction.",PubMed

In the lysates of phage-lambda-infected minicells the lambda DNA, trapped at a prereplicative step [Witkiewicz, H. and Taylor, K. (1979) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 564, 31-36], appeared in two peaks of different buoyant densities: as a membrane-bound and a free lambda DNA. The covalently-closed-circular form of lambda DNA appeared exclusively in the membrane fraction. The lambda-coded proteins, synthesized in lambda-infected minicells, appeared in two major fractions: as membrane-bound and as free proteins, and in one minor fraction, bound with free lambda DNA. Neither lambda protein engaged in the initiation of DNA replication was present in the fraction of free proteins: the P-gene product was membrane-associated, and the O-gene product formed a complex with free lambda DNA. The effect of high ionic strength (KCl) and of detergents (Triton X-100 and sarcosyl) on the binding of replication proteins with lambda DNA and with the membrane was studied. The non-ionic detergent, Triton X-100 caused displacement of a part of lambda DNA from the membrane to the free lambda DNA peak; both lambda replication proteins were bound with free lambda DNA. The binding of the O protein with lambda DNA was relatively stable, but was destroyed by the ionic detergent, sarcosyl.",PubMed

An amount of 10 ml of cell culture supernatant of short-term cultured lymphocytes (5 . 10(6) cells/ml) is quite sufficient for testing one cattle sample. The lower sensitivity limit of the test was found to be 10(6) virus particles. The test is properly reproducible, within tolerance limits of +/- 20--30 per cent, provided that optimum lysis conditions be maintained (0.01 per cent triton X-100, 20 minutes, 0--4 degrees C incubation) and under the condition that the protein quantity in 100 microliter test solution does not exceed the threshold of 3--15 micrograms. The specificity of the test is based on the use of free viruses from cell culture supernatant, the optimum temperature of the revertase reaction at 25 degrees C, which actually deviates from that for cellular DNA polymerases, that is 37 degrees C, and magnesium ion concentration which has to be optimum for bovine leucosis virus revertase. Two-hundred heads of cattle, differing by haematological status, were examined, and 56 per cent of them were, clearly, virus producers, among them 95 per cent of all animals with positively established leucosis and 36 per cent of the haematologically intact animals.

Cell wall lysin as a component of the bacteriophage phi 6 virion.,1979,10.1128/JVI.30.2.489-496.1979,469991,Journal of virology,"Cell wall lytic activity was found in particles of the lipid-containing bacteriophage ø6. The activity can be extracted from the virion with Triton X-100 in the presence of salt. This treatment removes the membrane-like envelope of the virion which includes five proteins. The lysin requires detergent for in vitro activity. Virus particles formed in nonsuppressor cells by several classes of ø6 nonsense mutants contained the lysin activity; however, particles formed by a mutant (unable to make proteins P5 and P11) had very low activity; high activity was produced when particles were formed in a suppressor host. A study of the time course of the appearance of the lysin during infection showed that it appeared and increased in cells infected with wild-type virus and in suppressor cells infected with a mutant of class 511, but it did not increase in nonsuppressor cells infected with the class 511 mutant. It is concluded that protein P5 is a component of the lysin and that the role of its activity is in both early and late stages of infection. In particular, the lysin may be necessary for the passage of the infecting core of the virion through the cell wall of the bacterium, as well as in the final lysis necessary for the liberation of progeny phage. A mutant of the virus that produces a larger-than-normal protein P10 does not induce normal lysin activity in host Pseudomonas phaseolicola HB10Y, although it does in strain ERA Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes. This indicates that protein P5 is probably not sufficient for lysin activity, but the nature of the interaction between P5 and P10 is unknown.",PubMed
The cytoskeletal framework and poliovirus metabolism.,1979,10.1016/0092-8674(79)90006-0,222454,Cell,"The cytoskeletal framework prepared by detergent lysis of suspension-grown HeLa cells is compared to the structure obtained from poliovirus-infected cells. This framework, which retains major features of cell morphology and carries the cellular polyribosomes as well as the major structural filaments, is profoundly reorganized following virus infection. This reorganization underlies, at least in part, the morphological changes termed the ""cytoplasmic effect."" These cytoskeletal changes appear related to the involvement of the framework with viral-specific metabolism. Extensive cytoskeleton alterations occur even when guanidine inhibits viral replication, and thus result from small amounts of early viral products. The normally spheroidal nucleus deforms, allowing a modified region of the cytoplasm to occupy a central position in the cell, and many membrane-enclosed vesicles peculiar to the infected cell are elaborated here. The skeleton preparation reveals that this region contains intermediate filaments arranged in a pattern unique to infected cells. Further changes occur when viral replication is permitted. The central region filaments become coated with darkly staining material which may be viral RNA. Numerous small particles appear on the filaments which resemble partially assembled virions. Mature virions, however, have no affinity for the cytoskeleton and appear to be free in the cytoplasm. Host cell messenger RNA, normally attached to the skeletal framework, is released in infected cells and is replaced by the viral-specific polyribosomes. The trabecular network which carries polyribosomes appears to be rearranged; the viral polyribosomes are located principally at the cell periphery and are excluded from the central region. The viral replication complex with its double-stranded RNA is also attached to the skeletal framework and may comprise the dark staining material coating the filaments of the central cell region.",PubMed

Disruption of the virus with Triton X-100 destroyed its ability to initiate the alternative pathway without affecting its ability to activate the classical pathway. After ultracentrifugation of disrupted virus the active component could be recovered in the supernate and was isolated by isoelectric focusing in granulated gels. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic and analysis and cyanogen bromide digestion studies revealed that the activity resided in a methionine-containing protein having a pI of 7.5 and a molecular weight of approximately equal to 15,000 daltons. The purified protein interacts strongly with Clq and efficiently activates Cl. RNase and lipolytic enzymes had no effect on the isolated protein but incubation with trypsin resulted in loss of activity.

State of adenovirus 2 deoxyribonucleic acid in the nucleus and its mode of transcription: studies with isolated viral deoxyribonucleic acid-protein complexes and isolated nuclei.,1972,10.1128/JVI.9.4.627-635.1972,5021309,Journal of virology,"Newly replicated adenovirus 2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can be isolated from the nucleus of HeLa cells by a gentle lysis procedure as a fairly homogeneous complex with a sedimentation of 73S. The viral DNA complex can be prepared completely free from host cell DNA. The viral complex is slightly active in ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in vitro. Treatment of the complex with Pronase and sodium dodecyl sulfate converts the DNA to a form which sediments at 43S. Nuclei isolated from adeno-infected cells synthesize high-molecular-weight virus-specific RNA in vitro. Optimal RNA synthesis requires a divalent cation, preferentially manganese, and relatively high salt concentrations. The synthesis of virus-specific RNA by the isolated nuclei is strongly inhibited by low doses of alpha-amanitine. The latter experimental result is discussed in terms of the polymerase used to transcribe the adenovirus DNA in vivo.",PubMed
Lysis from without of S. aureus K1 by the combined action of phage and virolysin.,1957,10.1085/jgp.41.2.343,13475696,The Journal of general physiology,"LYSIS FROM WITHOUT (LFW) OCCURS IN TWO STEPS: (1) sensitization of cells by phage, which renders the cells susceptible to (2) destruction of an essential cell structure by an extracellular lytic enzyme. Virolysin, from phage-infected cells, was used in these studies. Normal cell autolysin is also effective. Evidence is presented that: 1. Neither phage nor lysin alone causes LFW. 2. Sensitization requires phage adsorption. 3. It can be caused by non-infectious particles. This establishes a new biological activity of the particle. 4. Heat, U.V., detergents, penicillin, and other damaging agents also sensitize cells. 5. Sensitization involves a non-lethal, reversible reaction. 6. Sensitization by phage prevents virus synthesis. Following adsorption, a cell can undergo sensitization or infection but not simultaneously. When only a few particles are adsorbed, infection can occur; when sufficient particles are adsorbed, sensitization takes place. 7. Quantitative aspects of LFW are described. Lysis proceeds logarithmically. The lysis end-point depends upon the phage concentration but is independent of the enzyme concentration.",PubMed
